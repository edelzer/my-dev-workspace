## Context-Aware Documentation Standards

### Agent-Specific Documentation Requirements
- **Research Agents** (`/analyst`, `/pm`): Evidence-based documentation with sources and validation
- **Design Agents** (`/architect`, `/ux-expert`): Visual documentation with diagrams, wireframes, and specifications
- **Implementation Agents** (`/dev`, `/qa`): Technical documentation with code examples, test results, and metrics
- **Coordination Agents** (`/sm`, `/po`, `/bmad-orchestrator`): Process documentation with workflows, decisions, and outcomes

### Quality Standards for Agent Documentation
1. **Completeness**: All required sections completed with comprehensive information
2. **Accuracy**: All information validated and verified before documentation
3. **Traceability**: Clear links between requirements, design, implementation, and testing
4. **Maintainability**: Documentation structured for easy updates and long-term maintenance
5. **Accessibility**: Documentation accessible to all relevant stakeholders and agents

## Emergency Agent Protocols

### Agent Failure Recovery
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring detects agent communication failure
2. **Escalation**: `/bmad-orchestrator` escalates to `/bmad-master` for coordination
3. **Backup Procedures**: Manual handoff procedures activated with context preservation
4. **Recovery Validation**: Agent functionality validated before resuming automated coordination

### Quality Gate Failures
1. **Immediate Stop**: Workflow halted until quality issues resolved
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Relevant agents analyze failure causes and impact
3. **Remediation Plan**: Corrective actions defined with clear success criteria
4. **Validation**: Quality gates re-validated before workflow resumption

**Agent Coordination Integration Command**: When engaging any BMAD agent, ensure clear role definition, validate handoff requirements, maintain shared context, and confirm quality gate completion before phase transitions.
