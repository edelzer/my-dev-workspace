          ## Deployment Details
          - **Environment**: $ENV
          - **Version**: ${{ github.sha }}
          - **Branch/Tag**: ${{ github.ref }}
          - **Triggered by**: ${{ github.event_name }}
          - **Deploy Time**: $(date)
          
          ## Pre-Deployment Checklist
          - [x] Code compilation successful
          - [x] Linting passed
          - [x] Tests executed
          - [x] Build completed
          - [x] Security scan performed
          
          ## Deployment Strategy
          1. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Minimize downtime
          2. **Health Checks**: Validate service health
          3. **Rollback Plan**: Immediate rollback if issues detected
          4. **Monitoring**: Real-time application monitoring
          
          ## Post-Deployment Validation
          - [ ] Application health check
          - [ ] Smoke tests execution
          - [ ] Performance validation
          - [ ] User acceptance testing (if applicable)
