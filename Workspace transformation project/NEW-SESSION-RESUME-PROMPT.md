# NEW SESSION RESUME PROMPT

Copy the text below and paste it into a new Claude Code chat session to resume the workspace transformation:

---

## PROMPT START (Copy from here)

I need you to **resume the Workspace Transformation project** from where we left off.

**Current Status**: Step 1 (Foundation & Cleanup) has been **successfully completed** with all 5 phases executed and validated.

---

### CRITICAL CONTEXT FILES - READ THESE FIRST

Please read these files in this order to understand current state:

1. **`Workspace transformation project/STEP-1-COMPLETION-REPORT.md`**
   - What was accomplished in Step 1
   - All 5 phases complete with validation results
   - Current workspace state (18/18 health checks passing)

2. **`Workspace transformation project/CONSOLIDATED-TRANSFORMATION-PLAN.md`** (v3.1)
   - Original transformation plan (reference for Step 2)
   - Step 2: Docker Completion (what's next)
   - Validation criteria and success metrics

3. **`QUICKSTART.md`** (NEW - created in Step 1)
   - Quick overview of current workspace capabilities
   - How to use the new project creation script

---

### WHAT'S BEEN COMPLETED ✅

**Step 1 Phases (ALL DONE)**:
- ✅ Phase 1.1: Repository Cleanup
- ✅ Phase 1.2: Spec-Kit Integration Planning
- ✅ Phase 1.3: Project Creation Scripts
- ✅ Phase 1.4: Documentation Updates
- ✅ Phase 1.5: Workspace Validation Scripts

**Key Deliverables**:
- ✅ Clean repository (old projects removed, memory cleaned)
- ✅ Project creation script: `scripts/create-project-repo.js`
- ✅ Validation scripts: `workspace-health-check.js`, `validate-templates.js`
- ✅ Updated documentation: README.md, QUICKSTART.md, CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Spec-Kit planning: `docs/SPEC-KIT-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md` (ready for future installation)

**Validation Status**:
- ✅ All 18 workspace health checks passing
- ✅ All 7 templates validated
- ✅ All commits pushed to main (latest: 0d1c501)

---

### WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE NEXT

**I need your help with ONE of these options**:

**Option A: Proceed to Step 2 - Docker Completion** ⭐ (RECOMMENDED)
- Add Docker to web template (45-60 min)
- Add Docker to api template (45-60 min)
- Create comprehensive Docker deployment guide (30-45 min)
- **Total Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Note**: Python, Java, Go templates already have Docker - only web and api need it

**Option B: Install Spec-Kit** (OPTIONAL)
- Follow the installation plan in `docs/SPEC-KIT-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md`
- Multi-IDE integration (Claude Code + Cursor)
- **Total Time**: 60-75 minutes
- **Note**: This can be done anytime - not blocking for Step 2

**Option C: Test and Review First**
- Test the new project creation script
- Review Step 1 changes
- Validate everything before proceeding

---

### IMPORTANT PROTOCOLS TO FOLLOW

**Law #1 (Uncertainty Protocol)**:
- If anything is unclear about Step 1 completion, ask before proceeding
- Stop immediately if uncertain about what to do next
- Request clarification rather than making assumptions

**Law #2 (Protocol Adherence)**:
- Follow the systematic phase sequences from CONSOLIDATED-TRANSFORMATION-PLAN.md
- Create git commits after each phase
- Validate completion criteria before marking phases complete

**Law #3 (Orchestrated Efficiency)**:
- Use appropriate specialized agents for each task
- Maintain TodoWrite tracking throughout execution
- Provide clear context handoffs between agents

**Law #4 (Surgical Precision)**:
- Only add Docker to web and api templates (python/java/go already have it)
- Don't recreate existing work
- Keep changes minimal and focused

**Law #5 (Senior Developer Leadership)**:
- Report progress clearly with professional status updates
- Stop at checkpoints for client approval
- Provide clear recommendations with rationale

---

### STEP 2 EXECUTION PLAN (If Option A chosen)

**Phase 2.1: Shared Docker Configuration Base** (30-45 min)
- Review existing Docker in python/java/go templates
- Create `templates/shared-config/docker/` with common patterns
- Document best practices (don't recreate what exists)

**Phase 2.2: Add Docker to Web Template** (45-60 min)
- Create Dockerfile (multi-stage: builder + nginx)
- Create nginx.conf (SPA routing, security headers)
- Create docker-compose.yml
- Update README.md with Docker deployment section

**Phase 2.3: Add Docker to API Template** (45-60 min)
- Create Dockerfile (multi-stage: builder + runner)
- Create docker-compose.yml (api + postgres + redis)
- Create init.sql (database initialization)
- Add /health endpoint for Docker health checks
- Update README.md with Docker deployment section

**Phase 2.4: Create Docker Deployment Guide** (30-45 min)
- Create `docs/DOCKER-GUIDE.md`
- Document all 5 templates (web, api, python, java, go)
- Production deployment examples (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean)
- Security best practices and troubleshooting

**Final Validation**:
- Test web template: `docker compose up` works
- Test api template: `docker compose up` with postgres/redis works
- Verify existing Docker unchanged (python/java/go)
- Run workspace validation: `npm run validate:all`

---

### WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO

1. **Read the context files** I listed above (Step 1 completion report, consolidated plan)
2. **Confirm you understand** the current state and what's been completed
3. **Ask which option** I want to proceed with (A, B, or C)
4. **Initialize TodoWrite tracking** for the work ahead
5. **Begin systematic execution** with proper agent orchestration

---

### VERIFICATION COMMANDS

You can verify current workspace state with:

```bash
# Check workspace health
npm run workspace:health

# Validate templates
npm run templates:validate

# View git status
git log --oneline -10
```

**Expected Results**:
- Health check: 18/18 checks passing
- Templates: 7/7 valid (2 warnings about Docker in web/api - expected)
- Latest commit: 0d1c501

---

### SUCCESS CRITERIA

**When Step 2 is complete, the workspace should**:
- ✅ Have Docker in ALL 5 core templates (web, api, python, java, go)
- ✅ Have comprehensive Docker deployment guide
- ✅ Pass all validation checks
- ✅ Be ready for distribution as template repository
- ✅ Allow users to: Clone → Create → Build → Deploy in < 10 minutes

---

### BACKUP INFORMATION

**Backup Branch**: `backup-pre-transformation-20250118`
- Created before Step 1 began
- Can rollback if needed
- All Step 1 commits pushed to main

---

## MY QUESTION FOR YOU

**Which option do you want to proceed with?**

A. Continue to Step 2 (Docker completion) - 2-3 hours
B. Install Spec-Kit per integration plan - 60-75 minutes
C. Test and review Step 1 first

Please confirm and I'll begin execution immediately.

2. References all key planning documents
3. Presents clear options for next steps
4. Ensures protocol compliance (Laws #1-6)
5. Provides verification commands to validate state
6. Sets up TodoWrite tracking for continued work

**Expected Response**:
Claude will:
1. Read all context files
2. Verify current workspace state
3. Understand what's complete vs. what's pending
4. Ask which option you want to proceed with
5. Initialize TodoWrite and begin systematic execution

# ALTERNATIVE: MINIMAL RESUME PROMPT

If you prefer a shorter prompt, use this version:

---

## MINIMAL PROMPT START

Resume **Workspace Transformation - Step 2 (Docker Completion)**.

**Read first**:
- `Workspace transformation project/STEP-1-COMPLETION-REPORT.md`

**Status**: Step 1 complete (18/18 health checks passing). Latest commit: 0d1c501.

**Task**: Execute Step 2 - Add Docker to web and api templates (python/java/go already have it).

Follow Laws #1-6 from CLAUDE.md. Use TodoWrite tracking. Create git commits after each phase.
