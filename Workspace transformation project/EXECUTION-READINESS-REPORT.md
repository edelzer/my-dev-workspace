### ‚è≥ Decision 4: Execution Approach
**Status**: PENDING - Awaiting client selection

**Options**:
- **Option A**: Execute both Step 1 and Step 2 in one session (4-6 hours straight)
- **Option B**: Execute Step 1, pause for review, then Step 2 (checkpoint approach)
- **Option C**: Enhance plan with approval checkboxes first (40 min), then execute

**Recommendation**: Option B (checkpoint approach) - allows validation after Step 1

### ‚è≥ Decision 5: Timeline
**Status**: PENDING - Awaiting client confirmation

**Question**: Ready to execute today, or prefer to review updated plan first?

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Risk Level: LOW ‚úÖ

**Mitigations in Place**:
1. ‚úÖ Backup branch before starting (rollback point)
2. ‚úÖ Git commit after each phase (granular rollback)
3. ‚úÖ Validation gates prevent bad work from propagating
4. ‚úÖ Client decision points prevent unwanted changes
5. ‚úÖ Memory directory preserved (client concern addressed)
6. ‚úÖ Spec-Kit installation controlled by client (no assumptions)

**Confidence Level**: 90%

**Residual Risks**:
- Minor: Unexpected technical issues during execution (10% probability)
- Minor: Timeline variance ¬±1-2 hours (acceptable)

2. **"Ignored original plan"**: Fixed - Built on original Step 1 structure
3. **"Went crazy with Docker"**: Fixed - Only 2 templates need Docker, not 5
4. **"Want separate tasks"**: Fixed - Clear Step 1 / Step 2 separation

## READY TO BEGIN

### Final Questions for Client:

1. **Execution Approach**: Which option do you prefer?
   - Option A: Both steps in one session (4-6 hours)
   - Option B: Step 1, review, then Step 2 (checkpoint approach) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
   - Option C: Enhance plan first (40 min), then execute

2. **Timeline**: Are you ready to begin today, or prefer to review the updated plan first?

3. **Confirmation**: Confirm understanding that:
   - We'll STOP at Phase 1.2 for your Spec-Kit instructions
   - We'll STOP after Step 1 for your review (if Option B)
   - Memory directory structure will be preserved
   - All old projects will be deleted from `/projects`

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**Execute Option B** (checkpoint approach):
1. Execute Step 1 (2-3 hours)
2. Client reviews Step 1 completion
3. Client approves Step 2
4. Execute Step 2 (2-3 hours)
5. Client reviews final transformation

**Rationale**:
- Allows validation after foundation work
- Client can verify project scripts work
- Reduces risk of rework
- Maintains momentum while providing checkpoints

**If client ready**: I can begin immediately upon confirmation.

**If client wants review**: Happy to walk through updated plan sections first.

**Status**: ‚è≥ AWAITING CLIENT CONFIRMATION TO PROCEED

**Next Step**: Client selects execution approach and confirms ready to begin
