# BMAD vs Custom Agent Separation Strategy

**Objective**: Establish clear operational boundaries between BMAD strategic agents and Custom technical agents for independent operation and cross-validation

## Current Agent Inventory

### BMAD Strategic Agents (10 agents)
**Location**: `.bmad-core/` framework
**Focus**: Business strategy, planning, product management

1. **/analyst** - Market research, competitive analysis
2. **/pm** - Product management, requirements coordination  
3. **/architect** - Technical architecture, integration planning
4. **/po** - Product ownership, user story management
5. **/dev** - Development coordination (strategic level)
6. **/ux-expert** - User experience design and strategy
7. **/qa** - Quality assurance strategy and validation
8. **/sm** - Scrum master, agile process management
9. **/bmad-orchestrator** - Multi-agent coordination
10. **/bmad-master** - Framework oversight and optimization

### Custom Claude Code Agents (11 agents)
**Location**: `.claude/agents/`
**Focus**: Technical implementation, code execution

1. **project-manager** - Technical project coordination
2. **spec-analyst** - Technical requirements analysis
3. **spec-architect** - System architecture implementation
4. **spec-planner** - Technical task planning
5. **frontend-developer** - UI/UX implementation
6. **backend-developer** - Server-side implementation
7. **spec-developer** - Full-stack integration
8. **spec-tester** - Testing implementation
9. **spec-reviewer** - Code review and quality
10. **spec-validator** - Technical validation
11. **security-specialist** - Security implementation

## Team Separation Strategy

### Clear Responsibility Boundaries

#### BMAD Team Responsibilities:
```
STRATEGIC PLANNING & BUSINESS ANALYSIS
├── Market research and competitive analysis (/analyst)
├── Product strategy and roadmap (/pm, /po)
├── Business architecture and technology selection (/architect)
├── User experience strategy (/ux-expert)
├── Quality strategy and acceptance criteria (/qa)
├── Process optimization and agile coaching (/sm)
├── Cross-project coordination (/bmad-orchestrator)
└── Framework evolution (/bmad-master)
```

#### Custom Team Responsibilities:
```
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION & EXECUTION
├── Technical project execution (project-manager)
├── Requirements implementation (spec-analyst, spec-planner)
├── System architecture implementation (spec-architect)
├── Frontend/backend development (frontend-developer, backend-developer)
├── Full-stack integration (spec-developer)
├── Testing and validation (spec-tester, spec-validator)
├── Code review and quality assurance (spec-reviewer)
└── Security implementation (security-specialist)
```

### Team Operation Models

#### Model 1: Independent Parallel Operation
**Use Case**: When teams can work on separate aspects simultaneously

**BMAD Team Flow:**
```
/analyst → /pm → /po → /architect (business architecture)
         ↓
/ux-expert → /qa (strategy) → /sm (process)
         ↓
/bmad-orchestrator (coordination)
```

**Custom Team Flow:**
```
spec-analyst → spec-architect → spec-planner
         ↓
frontend-developer + backend-developer → spec-developer
         ↓
spec-tester → spec-reviewer → spec-validator
         ↓
security-specialist (implementation validation)
```

#### Model 2: Sequential Handoff Operation
**Use Case**: When one team's output becomes the other team's input

**Sequence 1: BMAD → Custom**
```
BMAD Planning Phase:
/analyst → /pm → /po → /architect
         ↓
Strategic handoff to Custom team
         ↓
Custom Implementation Phase:
spec-analyst → spec-architect → implementation team
```

**Sequence 2: Custom → BMAD**
```
Custom Implementation Phase:
Technical development and testing
         ↓
Technical handoff to BMAD team
         ↓
BMAD Validation Phase:
/qa → /sm → /bmad-orchestrator (strategic validation)
```

#### Model 3: Cross-Validation Operation
**Use Case**: When teams check each other's work

**BMAD Validates Custom Output:**
```
Custom Technical Delivery
         ↓
/qa (strategic quality validation)
/pm (business requirements validation)
/architect (architecture compliance validation)
         ↓
BMAD Strategic Approval/Feedback
```

**Custom Validates BMAD Output:**
```
BMAD Strategic Plan
         ↓
spec-architect (technical feasibility validation)
spec-planner (implementation planning validation)
security-specialist (security compliance validation)
         ↓
Custom Technical Approval/Feedback
```
