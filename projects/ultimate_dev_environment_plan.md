- ‚úÖ **Tools Working:** Cursor IDE, Claude Code initialized, GitHub Desktop setup
- ‚úÖ **MCP Status:** Filesystem and GitHub MCP servers active, Playwright failed (optional)

#### **Session Management Strategy:**
1. **Always reference this document** at start of each session
2. **Update checkboxes** as you complete components
3. **Share current phase progress** when starting new chat sessions
4. **Use `/compact` in Claude Code** to manage context in long sessions
5. **Commit changes frequently** to maintain progress checkpoints

#### **Key Commands to Remember:**
```bash
# Essential Claude Code commands for reference
claude /config                    # Access configuration menu
claude /mcp                       # Check MCP server status  
claude config list                # View all configuration options
claude mcp add [server] [path]    # Add new MCP servers
/rule2hook "description"          # Create natural language automation
/agents                          # Manage sub-agent configurations
```

### **üîë Revolutionary Discoveries (Why This Plan Is Critical)**

#### **Rule2Hook Natural Language Automation**
- **What:** Convert plain English descriptions into Claude Code hooks
- **Why Critical:** Eliminates manual JSON configuration, enables rapid workflow automation
- **Example:** `/rule2hook "Format Python files after editing"` ‚Üí Auto-generates hook configuration
- **Impact:** Transforms development workflow automation from expert-level to accessible

#### **Memory & Sequential Thinking MCP Servers**
- **What:** Persistent context across sessions + enhanced reasoning capabilities
- **Why Critical:** Maintains project knowledge and enables complex multi-step reasoning
- **Current Gap:** Without these, each session starts fresh with no memory
- **Impact:** Enables true AI assistant continuity and advanced problem-solving

#### **Advanced Agent Orchestration**
- **What:** Quality gates, handoff protocols, parallel execution management
- **Why Critical:** Enables true multi-agent development teams with professional workflows
- **Current State:** Basic agents exist but lack coordination mechanisms
- **Impact:** Transforms from individual AI helpers to coordinated development team

#### **Enterprise Security Integration**
- **What:** Managed policies, authentication, secure containers, proxy support
- **Why Critical:** Required for professional/corporate development environments
- **Current Gap:** Basic setup lacks enterprise-grade security measures
- **Impact:** Enables deployment in corporate/team environments with confidence

### **üìã Phase Dependencies & Prerequisites**

#### **Phase 1 Dependencies:**
- **Existing Workspace:** Must have functional Claude Code + Cursor setup
- **Administrative Access:** Required for enterprise policy configuration
- **Network Access:** Needed for MCP server installation and configuration

#### **Phase 2 Dependencies:**
- **Phase 1 Completion:** Advanced MCP servers must be functional
- **Agent Framework:** BMAD-METHOD or equivalent must be installed
- **Project Context:** CLAUDE.md files and project structure established

#### **Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Don't skip Phase 1** - Foundation must be solid before building agents
2. **Test each MCP server** after installation before proceeding
3. **Backup configurations** before making major changes
4. **Document agent interactions** as you build the team

### **üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Notes**

2. Sequential-thinking MCP - Enhances reasoning
3. Context7 MCP - Framework documentation
4. Magic MCP - Component generation
5. IDE Diagnostics MCP - Error integration
6. ESLint MCP - Code quality
7. Task Queue MCP - Load balancing
```

#### **Agent Creation Best Practices:**
- **Start with Core Team:** Main Agent ‚Üí Task Distributor ‚Üí Requirements Analyst
- **Test Individual Agents:** Verify each agent works independently before orchestration
- **Document Agent Roles:** Clear CLAUDE.md instructions for each agent
- **Establish Handoff Protocols:** Define how agents pass work between each other

#### **Security Configuration Priority:**
1. **Managed Policies:** Set organization-wide standards first
2. **Authentication:** Configure enterprise identity integration
3. **Container Security:** Implement secure development containers
4. **Network Policies:** Configure proxy and firewall rules
