## CLAUDE.md Optimization Strategy

### Current CLAUDE.md Issues

1. **Repetition**: Protocol descriptions repeated in multiple sections
2. **Size**: ~900 lines is heavy to process every session
3. **Mixed Concerns**: Implementation details mixed with high-level laws
4. **Example Overload**: Many examples that could be in Skills
5. **Static Content**: Doesn't evolve with learnings

### Optimization Approach

#### Phase 1: Extract to Skills (Immediate)

**Extract these to Skills**:

1. **Uncertainty Protocol Examples** ‚Üí `uncertainty-protocol-enforcer` Skill
   - Current lines: ~50 lines of examples in Law #1A
   - **Reduction**: 30-40 lines (keep core principle, extract enforcement details)

2. **Specification Drift Examples** ‚Üí `specification-adherence-checker` Skill
   - Current lines: ~60 lines in Law #1B
   - **Reduction**: 40-50 lines (keep principle, extract checkpoints)

3. **Surgical Level Descriptions** ‚Üí `surgical-precision-guide` Skill
   - Current lines: ~70 lines in Law #4
   - **Reduction**: 50-60 lines (keep hierarchy, extract application details)

4. **Technical Debt Protocol** ‚Üí `technical-debt-evaluator` Skill
   - Current lines: Scattered across Integration Framework
   - **Reduction**: Can consolidate to Skill, reduce CLAUDE.md mentions

5. **Security Protocol Details** ‚Üí `security-first-analyzer` Skill
   - Current lines: Security protocol descriptions
   - **Reduction**: Keep high-level, extract workflow to Skill

**Total Estimated Reduction**: 150-200 lines (~17-22% reduction)

#### Phase 2: Simplify Core Laws (After Skills proven)

**Restructure CLAUDE.md**:
```
OLD STRUCTURE:
- Law #1A: Uncertainty (100+ lines with examples, responses, triggers)
- Law #1B: Specification (100+ lines with checkpoints, examples)
- etc.

NEW STRUCTURE:
- Law #1A: Uncertainty (30 lines - core principle)
  ‚Üí Enforcement: `uncertainty-protocol-enforcer` Skill (auto-activates)
- Law #1B: Specification (30 lines - core principle)
  ‚Üí Enforcement: `specification-adherence-checker` Skill (auto-activates)
- etc.
```

**Result**: Each Law becomes ~70% shorter, Skills handle enforcement

#### Phase 3: Dynamic Content (Long-term)

**Make CLAUDE.md evolve**:
- Skills learn and improve enforcement over time
- CLAUDE.md stays stable (principles don't change)
- Learning captured in Skills + memory, not static documentation

### Migration Strategy

1. **Create Skills first** (don't touch CLAUDE.md yet)
2. **Test Skills thoroughly** (ensure they work correctly)
3. **Verify no functionality loss** (Skills enforce what docs describe)
4. **Gradually extract** (one Law at a time, not all at once)
5. **Keep rollback option** (maintain old CLAUDE.md version)
6. **Client approval required** (per Law #5 - get sign-off on changes)

### What MUST Stay in CLAUDE.md

**Non-negotiable content**:
- 6 Laws titles and core principles (the "why")
- Quick Reference Guide
- Agent team structure
- Project templates overview
- External tool integrations
- Development standards summary

**What can move to Skills**:
- Protocol enforcement mechanisms (the "how")
- Detailed examples and scenarios
- Response templates
- Validation checklists
- Troubleshooting procedures

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Risks

#### Risk 1: Skill Redundancy (Medium Probability, High Impact)
**Scenario**: Custom Skill duplicates existing Skill functionality
**Mitigation**:
- Thorough gap analysis before creation (completed ‚úÖ)
- Test integration with existing Skills
- Review `.claude/skills/README.md` before each Skill
- If redundancy discovered: Delete custom Skill, use existing

#### Risk 2: CLAUDE.md Optimization Breaks Functionality (Low Probability, High Impact)
**Scenario**: Extracting content to Skills loses critical guidance
**Mitigation**:
- Skills must be proven stable before CLAUDE.md changes
- Client approval required (Law #5)
- Keep backup of original CLAUDE.md
- Gradual extraction (one Law at a time)
- Rollback plan prepared

#### Risk 3: Skills Don't Auto-Activate (Medium Probability, Medium Impact)
**Scenario**: Trigger conditions not correctly specified
**Mitigation**:
- Test activation extensively with subagents
- Refine trigger conditions based on testing
- Use `testing-skills-with-subagents` validation
- Iterate on trigger descriptions

#### Risk 4: Memory Integration Fails (Low Probability, Medium Impact)
**Scenario**: `session-recovery` or `knowledge-capture` don't work with `/memories/`
**Mitigation**:
- Test memory integration thoroughly
- Verify file paths and permissions
- Use existing memory structure (don't reinvent)
- Fallback: Skills work without memory, enhanced with it

#### Risk 5: Skill Creation Takes Longer Than Estimated (High Probability, Low Impact)
**Scenario**: Complex Skills take 90 minutes instead of 60
**Mitigation**:
- Estimates include buffer (45-75 min ranges)
- Flexible session planning
- Can defer lower-priority Skills
- Quality over speed (Law #4)

### Contingency Plans

**If Session 1 runs long**:
- Defer `session-recovery` to Session 2
- Focus on `uncertainty-protocol-enforcer` + `specification-adherence-checker`

**If Skills prove too complex**:
- Simplify Skill scope
- Start with basic version, enhance later
- Use existing Skills more extensively

**If CLAUDE.md optimization seems risky**:
- Keep current CLAUDE.md
- Skills enhance rather than replace
- Defer optimization to later project

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Session)

1. ‚úÖ **Review this project plan** with client
2. ‚úÖ **Get approval** to proceed with Phase 1
3. ‚úÖ **Schedule Session 1** (2.5-3 hours)

### Session 1 Preparation

**Before starting Session 1**:
- [ ] Review `.claude/skills/README.md` to confirm existing Skills
- [ ] Re-read CLAUDE.md Laws #1A, #1B, #6
- [ ] Confirm `skill-creator` is working
- [ ] Prepare test scenarios for validation

**Session 1 Kickoff**:
```
Request: "Let's start Phase 1 of the custom Skills development project.
Create the uncertainty-protocol-enforcer Skill first."

Expected: skill-creator auto-activates and guides creation
```

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Skills Creation Quick Reference

```bash
# For each Skill:
1. "Help me create a custom Skill for [purpose]"
   ‚Üí skill-creator guides design

2. Implement SKILL.md following guidance

3. "Test the [skill-name] Skill with subagents"
   ‚Üí testing-skills-with-subagents validates

4. Update .claude/skills/README.md with new Skill

5. Mark complete in this project file
```

### Appendix B: CLAUDE.md Optimization Template

**Before** (Law #1A example):
```
## Law #1A: STOP WHEN UNCERTAIN

[100+ lines of examples, triggers, responses, scenarios]
```

**After** (with Skill):
```
## Law #1A: STOP WHEN UNCERTAIN

If you are unsure about ANY of the following, STOP immediately:
- The next step to take
- Requirements interpretation
- Expected outcomes

**Enforcement**: `uncertainty-protocol-enforcer` Skill auto-activates
when uncertainty is detected and triggers the mandatory STOP protocol.

See .claude/skills/README.md for Skill details.
```

### Appendix C: Testing Checklist

**For each custom Skill**:
- [ ] Skill auto-activates in relevant context
- [ ] Skill does NOT activate in irrelevant context
- [ ] Skill integrates with related Skills
- [ ] Skill documented correctly
- [ ] No redundancy with existing 35 Skills
- [ ] Tested with subagents (using `testing-skills-with-subagents`)
- [ ] Memory integration working (for session-recovery, knowledge-capture)
