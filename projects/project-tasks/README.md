# Ultimate AI Development Environment - Project Tasks

This folder contains detailed task lists for implementing the ultimate AI-powered development environment across 6 comprehensive phases.

## 📋 Phase Overview

| Phase | Focus | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Phase 1** | Foundation & Global Configuration | 4-5 hours | None (builds on current setup) |
| **Phase 2** | AI Development Team Architecture | 3-4 hours | Phase 1 complete |
| **Phase 3** | BMAD Method Integration & Advanced Workflows | 2-3 hours | Phase 1 & 2 complete |
| **Phase 4** | Professional Documentation & Templates | 1-2 hours | Phase 1-3 complete |
| **Phase 5** | Advanced Features & Optimization | 2-3 hours | Phase 1-4 complete |
| **Phase 6** | Vibe Coding Methodology Integration | 1-2 hours | Phase 1-5 complete |

**Total Estimated Time:** 12-15 hours (distributed across multiple sessions)

## 🎯 Critical Path Priorities

### Must Complete First (Essential Foundation):
1. **Memory MCP Server** - Persistent context across sessions
2. **Sequential-thinking MCP** - Enhanced reasoning capabilities  
3. **Rule2Hook Installation** - Natural language automation
4. **Core Agent Team** - Foundation for all development work

### High Impact Quick Wins:
1. **Context7 MCP** - Immediate framework documentation access
2. **IDE Diagnostics MCP** - Real-time error detection
3. **GitHub Actions Setup** - Automated workflow integration
4. **Enterprise Security Config** - Professional-grade security

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Each Session:
1. **Reference the main plan:** `../ultimate_dev_environment_plan.md`
2. **Choose current phase** based on dependencies and progress
3. **Open corresponding task file** for detailed checklist
4. **Update checkboxes** as you complete items
5. **Commit changes** to track progress

### Session Commands:
```bash
# Navigate to workspace
cd C:\Users\edelz\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\development\my-dev-workspace

# Check current MCP status  
claude /mcp

# View current configuration
claude config list

# Check agent status
claude /agents
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Each phase has specific validation criteria that must be met before proceeding:

- **Phase 1:** All MCP servers "Connected & Active", Rule2Hook functional
- **Phase 2:** Core agents respond appropriately, handoff protocols work
- **Phase 3:** BMAD integration functional, advanced workflows operational  
- **Phase 4:** Documentation system complete, templates validated
- **Phase 5:** Advanced features stable, performance monitoring active
- **Phase 6:** Vibe Coding integrated, complete system validated

## 🔧 Multi-Session Strategy

### Starting New Sessions:
1. Share current progress with Claude
2. Reference specific phase and completed items
3. Identify any issues encountered
4. Set clear goals for the session

### During Implementation:
1. Update task checkboxes in real-time
2. Document any issues or solutions
3. Test each component before proceeding
4. Commit configuration changes frequently

### Session Completion:
1. Update progress in main plan document
2. Note any partial completions or issues
3. Set next session goals
4. Backup all configurations

## 🚨 Critical Dependencies

**Never skip phases or ignore dependencies!** Each phase builds on previous work:

- Phase 1 provides the foundation MCP servers required for all other phases
- Phase 2 creates the agent team that orchestrates all development work  
- Phase 3 implements the enterprise methodology for professional workflows
- Phase 4 creates the documentation and templates for maintainability
- Phase 5 adds advanced features and optimization for peak performance
- Phase 6 integrates the revolutionary Vibe Coding methodology

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **MCP Connection Failures:** Install servers individually, check network access
- **Agent Coordination Problems:** Verify handoff protocols, check context preservation
- **Context Loss:** Ensure Memory MCP is active, update CLAUDE.md regularly
- **Windows-Specific Issues:** Use `cmd /c` wrapper for problematic commands

### Key Resources:
- **Claude Code Docs:** https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code
- **MCP Protocol:** https://modelcontextprotocol.io/
- **BMAD-METHOD:** https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD
- **Rule2Hook:** https://github.com/zxdxjtu/claudecode-rule2hook
