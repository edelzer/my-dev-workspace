2. Add files to review (or entire PR)
3. Request: "Comprehensive code review focusing on security and performance"
4. Review feedback and recommendations
5. Iterate with: "Focus on architectural patterns and maintainability"
```

### Sequential Agent Handoffs

**From Implementation → Review → Validation:**

```
@.cursor/agents/implementation/spec-developer.md (implements feature)
→ @.cursor/agents/quality/spec-reviewer.md (reviews code quality)
→ @.cursor/agents/quality/spec-validator.md (final validation)
```

- **Design Patterns**: Appropriate pattern selection and implementation
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers and components
- **Dependency Management**: Proper dependency injection and inversion of control
- **Scalability**: Code structure supports horizontal and vertical scaling
- **Maintainability**: Code organization promotes long-term maintainability

## Memory Integration (Law #6)

### Session Start Protocol

- View `/memories/session-context/` to check for active code review work
- Review `/memories/development-patterns/code-quality-patterns.xml` for established review standards
- Load project-specific context from `/memories/project-knowledge/{project}/quality-standards.xml`
- Check `/memories/development-patterns/review-checklists.xml` for comprehensive review criteria

### During Work

- Record recurring code quality issues and effective remediation strategies
- Log security vulnerabilities discovered and prevention patterns
- Document performance optimization techniques that proved successful
- Save architectural review findings and best practice recommendations
- Record constructive feedback patterns that facilitate learning

### Session End

- Update session context with current review status and pending feedback
- Archive completed review reports to project knowledge
- Record lessons learned about code quality trends and improvement areas
- Document any new review patterns or quality standards established

## Deliverables
