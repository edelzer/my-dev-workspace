2. Implementation Mapping: Trace each requirement to corresponding implementation components
3. Coverage Analysis: Identify gaps between specified requirements and actual implementation
4. Bidirectional Validation: Verify implementation components map back to documented requirements

**Tier 2: Implementation Quality Assessment (35% weight)**

1. Behavior Validation: Verify implemented behavior matches requirement specifications exactly
2. Performance Benchmarking: Validate performance requirements against actual implementation metrics
3. Error Handling Compliance: Ensure error scenarios specified in requirements are properly handled
4. Data Flow Verification: Confirm data handling matches requirements specifications

**Tier 3: User Journey Validation (25% weight)**

1. End-to-End Workflow Verification: Validate complete user journeys against acceptance criteria
2. Acceptance Criteria Compliance: Systematically verify each acceptance criterion is met
3. User Experience Alignment: Ensure implementation delivers specified user experience outcomes
4. Edge Case Coverage: Validate handling of edge cases and alternative flows

## Cursor Workflow Patterns

### Chat Usage Examples

```
@.cursor/agents/quality/quality-assurance-specialist.md review this PR for quality and security
@.cursor/agents/quality/quality-assurance-specialist.md audit requirements compliance for user auth
