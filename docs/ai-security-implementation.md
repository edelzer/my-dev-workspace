```bash
# Verify token configuration
echo $SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN

# Test connection
claude ai-security-scan --test-connection

# Check MCP configuration
cat .claude/mcp/semgrep-config.json
```

**Performance issues**:
```bash
# Use quick scan mode
claude ai-security-scan --quick-scan --critical-only

# Enable caching
export AI_SECURITY_CACHE=true

# Reduce scan scope
claude ai-security-scan src/ --exclude "test/**"
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable detailed logging
DEBUG=1 claude ai-security-scan
DEBUG=1 node scripts/ai-security/validate.js findings.json
```
