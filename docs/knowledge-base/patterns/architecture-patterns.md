# Architecture Patterns

## Overview
This document captures architectural patterns commonly used in our development workspace, providing guidance for system design and technology selection decisions.

## Microservices Architecture Patterns

### Service Decomposition Patterns
- **Decompose by Business Capability**: Organize services around business functions
- **Decompose by Subdomain**: Use Domain-Driven Design subdomain boundaries
- **Self-Contained Service**: Each service manages its own data and business logic

### Communication Patterns
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for all client requests
- **Service Mesh**: Infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous communication through events

### Data Management Patterns
- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data
- **Shared Database Anti-Pattern**: Avoid shared databases between services
- **Event Sourcing**: Store state changes as events
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write operations

## Frontend Architecture Patterns

### Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design**: Break UI into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages
- **Container/Presenter**: Separate business logic from presentation
- **Higher-Order Components**: Reusable component logic
- **Render Props**: Share component state through function props

### State Management Patterns
- **Flux/Redux**: Unidirectional data flow
- **Context API**: React built-in state management
- **Component State**: Local component state management
- **Server State**: Managing server-side state separately

## Security Architecture Patterns

### Authentication Patterns
- **JWT Tokens**: Stateless authentication with JSON Web Tokens
- **OAuth 2.0**: Delegated authorization framework
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Additional security layers
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling

### Authorization Patterns
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access based on user roles
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Fine-grained attribute-based access
- **Policy-Based Authorization**: Centralized policy management
- **Resource-Based Authorization**: Access control per resource

## Performance Architecture Patterns

### Caching Patterns
- **CDN Caching**: Content delivery network for static assets
- **Application Caching**: In-memory application caching
- **Database Caching**: Query result caching
- **Browser Caching**: Client-side caching strategies

### Scalability Patterns
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale by adding more instances
- **Vertical Scaling**: Scale by adding more power to existing instances
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute load across multiple instances
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on metrics

## AI Development Team Integration

### Requirements Analysis Patterns
- **User Story Mapping**: Visual representation of user journeys
- **Domain Modeling**: Model business domain and relationships
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Detailed acceptance criteria definition
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify and analyze stakeholders

### System Design Patterns
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document architectural decisions
- **Technology Radar**: Track technology adoption
- **Reference Architecture**: Standard architecture templates
- **Design Patterns Catalog**: Reusable design solutions

## BMAD Multi-Agent Patterns

### Agent Coordination Patterns
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinate multi-agent workflows
- **Handoff Protocols**: Standardized agent handoff procedures
- **Quality Gates**: Validation checkpoints between agents
- **Shared Context**: Common context sharing mechanisms

### Planning Phase Patterns
- **Market Analysis**: Competitive analysis and market research
- **Requirements Gathering**: Systematic requirements elicitation
- **Architecture Planning**: System design and technology selection
- **Project Planning**: Task decomposition and estimation

## Usage Guidelines

### Pattern Selection
1. **Assess Requirements**: Understand functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Evaluate Options**: Compare different pattern options
3. **Consider Trade-offs**: Analyze benefits and drawbacks
4. **Document Decision**: Record pattern selection rationale
5. **Validate Implementation**: Ensure pattern is correctly implemented

### Pattern Documentation
1. **Context**: When to use this pattern
2. **Problem**: What problem does it solve
3. **Solution**: How the pattern solves the problem
4. **Consequences**: Benefits and trade-offs
5. **Examples**: Real implementation examples
