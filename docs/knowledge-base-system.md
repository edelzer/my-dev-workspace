  },
};
```

#### Learning Analytics Engine

```javascript
// Pattern analysis and learning system
const LearningEngine = {
  // Pattern recognition algorithms
  analyzePatterns: async (data) => {
    // AI-powered pattern detection
  },

  // Recommendation generation
  generateRecommendations: async (context) => {
    // Context-aware suggestion system
  },

  // Performance optimization
  optimizeWorkflows: async (metrics) => {
    // Data-driven workflow improvements
  },
};
```

#### Knowledge API

```javascript
// RESTful API for knowledge access
const KnowledgeAPI = {
  // Search knowledge base
  search: async (query, context) => {
    // Semantic search with context awareness
  },

  // Get recommendations
  recommend: async (currentTask) => {
    // AI-powered recommendation engine
