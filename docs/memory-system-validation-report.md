## Memory Tool Commands Reference

**From CLAUDE.md Law #6 (lines 594-603):**

```bash
view /memories/                              # List memory directory
view /memories/session-context/active-project.xml  # Read specific file
create /memories/{path}                      # Create or overwrite file
str_replace /memories/{path}                 # Replace text in file
insert /memories/{path}                      # Insert at line number
delete /memories/{path}                      # Delete file/directory
rename /memories/{old}  /memories/{new}      # Rename/move file
```

✅ **Perfect alignment with Anthropic specification**

## Session Start Protocol Comparison

**Anthropic Auto-Prompt:**
```
IMPORTANT: ALWAYS VIEW YOUR MEMORY DIRECTORY BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE.
MEMORY PROTOCOL:
1. Use the `view` command of your `memory` tool to check for earlier progress.
2. ... (work on the task) ...
   - As you make progress, record status / progress / thoughts etc in your memory.
ASSUME INTERRUPTION: Your context window might be reset at any moment...
```

**Our CLAUDE.md Law #6 Protocol (More Comprehensive):**
```
Before ANY work, you MUST:
1. VIEW `/memories/session-context/` to understand current state
2. READ `/memories/protocol-compliance/` to check for pending Law violations
3. REVIEW `/memories/client-context/preferences.xml` for client guidance
4. LOAD relevant project knowledge from `/memories/project-knowledge/{project}/`
5. SYNC TodoWrite status with memory records

NEVER start work without first checking memory—your context window may have been reset.
```

✅ **Our version is MORE COMPREHENSIVE** - includes all Anthropic requirements plus:
- Law compliance integration
- Client context awareness
- Project-specific knowledge loading
- TodoWrite synchronization
- Multi-subdirectory coverage

## Minor Gaps Identified

### Gap #1: Template Files Not Pre-Populated (-3 points)

**Current State:**
- All 6 subdirectories exist
- Subdirectories are empty (no `.xml` files)
- Templates are documented in README.md

**Anthropic Recommendation:**
- Pre-populate with example XML structures
- Helps users understand expected format

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Functionality Impact**: None - documentation provides complete examples
- **User Experience**: Slightly reduced immediate usability
- **Risk**: Low - doesn't affect core functionality

**Recommendation**: OPTIONAL enhancement - create starter template files in each subdirectory

### Gap #2: Context Editing Integration Not Documented (-2 points)

**Current State:**
- No mention of context editing in CLAUDE.md
- Memory system works standalone

**Anthropic Feature:**
- Optional context management for long workflows
- Automatically clears old tool results when approaching context limits
- Memory system preserves critical information before clearing

**Example Configuration (from Anthropic docs):**
```python
context_management={
    "edits": [{
        "type": "clear_tool_uses_20250919",
        "trigger": {"type": "input_tokens", "value": 100000},
        "keep": {"type": "tool_uses", "value": 3},
        "exclude_tools": ["memory"]  # Preserve memory operations
    }]
}
```

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Severity**: Minimal
- **Functionality Impact**: None for typical sessions
- **User Experience**: May benefit extremely long sessions
- **Risk**: Very Low - Claude Code may handle automatically

**Recommendation**: OPTIONAL documentation enhancement - add note about context editing compatibility

## Validation Test Results

**Script**: `scripts/validate-memory-path.js`

## Optional Enhancement Recommendations

### Enhancement #1: Pre-populate Template XML Files

**Priority**: LOW
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Impact**: Improved user experience for first-time setup

**Proposed Action:**
Create starter template files in each subdirectory with example XML structures based on README.md documentation.

**Files to Create:**
```
memories/
├── session-context/
│   ├── active-project.xml (template)
│   ├── phase-status.xml (template)
│   └── pending-decisions.xml (template)
├── protocol-compliance/
│   ├── uncertainty-log.xml (template)
│   ├── spec-adherence.xml (template)
│   ├── protocol-status.xml (template)
│   └── efficiency-metrics.xml (template)
├── agent-coordination/
│   ├── handoff-log.xml (template)
│   ├── context-packages.xml (template)
│   └── quality-gates.xml (template)
├── development-patterns/
│   ├── debugging-solutions.xml (template)
│   ├── security-patterns.xml (template)
│   ├── test-strategies.xml (template)
│   └── task-templates.xml (template)
├── client-context/
│   ├── preferences.xml (template)
│   ├── communication-log.xml (template)
│   └── approval-history.xml (template)
└── project-knowledge/
    └── _template.xml (example structure)
```

### Enhancement #2: Add Context Editing Documentation

**Priority**: LOW
**Effort**: 30 minutes
**Impact**: Better understanding of long-session workflows

**Proposed Addition to CLAUDE.md Law #6:**

```markdown
## Context Editing Integration (Optional)

The memory system is fully compatible with Anthropic's context editing feature for managing extremely long sessions.

**How Context Editing Works with Memory:**
1. When conversation approaches context limit, Claude receives warning
2. Claude preserves critical information to memory files before clearing
3. Context editing automatically clears old tool results
4. Claude retrieves stored information from memory files when needed
5. Workflow continues indefinitely with managed context

**Configuration (API Usage):**
Context editing is typically handled automatically by Claude Code. For API implementations:

```python
context_management={
    "edits": [{
        "type": "clear_tool_uses_20250919",
        "trigger": {"type": "input_tokens", "value": 100000},
        "keep": {"type": "tool_uses", "value": 3},
        "exclude_tools": ["memory"]  # Preserve memory operations
    }]
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Memory system automatically handles preservation during context clearing
- Critical decisions, agent handoffs, and protocol status are always saved
- Long-running projects benefit from memory + context editing combination
- No manual intervention required - system manages automatically

For complete details, see [Anthropic Context Editing Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-editing).
```
