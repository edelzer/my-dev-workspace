# Spec-Kit Integration Planning Documentation

**Status**: PLANNING PHASE - Not Yet Installed
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Phase**: 1.2 - Integration Planning Complete

---

## 1. Overview

### What is Spec-Kit?

Spec-Kit is GitHub's formal specification-driven development framework designed for projects requiring comprehensive upfront documentation, regulatory compliance, and structured multi-phase development cycles. It provides a command-based workflow that guides teams through:

- Constitutional principles establishment (`/constitution`)
- Detailed specification creation (`/specify`)
- Technical planning and architecture (`/plan`)
- Task breakdown and estimation (`/tasks`)
- Implementation execution (`/implement`)

### Why We're Integrating Spec-Kit

Spec-Kit provides an additional workflow methodology that can be used independently or alongside our existing BMAD and custom agent workflows for projects that require:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Healthcare, finance, government projects
- **Client-Facing Documentation**: Fixed-bid contracts, external stakeholder projects
- **Complex System Design**: Multi-team coordination, enterprise architecture
- **Audit Requirements**: Projects requiring comprehensive paper trails
- **Formal Specifications**: Detailed upfront planning and documentation

### Installation Status

**PLANNED - NOT YET INSTALLED**

This document serves as the blueprint for future Spec-Kit installation. No installation has occurred. Installation will be executed when needed based on project requirements and approved by client.

## 2. Installation Approach

### Recommended Method: Enhanced Template-Based Integration (Option 2B)

Based on technical analysis by spec-architect, we will implement Enhanced Template-Based Integration combining the best features of multiple approaches:

**Why This Approach:**

1. **Cross-IDE Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across Claude Code and Cursor
2. **Offline Fallback**: Cached commands provide functionality without network dependency
3. **Latest Content**: Downloads fresh Spec-Kit content from GitHub on demand
4. **Performance**: Lightweight command files with lazy loading of full specifications
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between command interface and content caching
6. **Workflow Independence**: Spec-Kit operates as standalone workflow while remaining available to all agents

**Architecture Overview:**

```
.spec-kit/
├── commands/                    # Lightweight command entry points
│   ├── constitution.md         # /constitution command (universal)
│   ├── specify.md              # /specify command (universal)
│   ├── plan.md                 # /plan command (universal)
│   ├── tasks.md                # /tasks command (universal)
│   └── implement.md            # /implement command (universal)
│
├── cache/                       # Downloaded Spec-Kit content
│   ├── prompts/                # Full specification prompts
│   ├── templates/              # Document templates
│   └── guidelines/             # Best practices and patterns
│
├── scripts/                     # Download and management utilities
│   ├── update-spec-kit.ps1    # PowerShell download script
│   ├── update-spec-kit.sh     # Bash download script
│   └── verify-cache.js        # Cache validation utility
│
└── config/
    ├── spec-kit.json           # Configuration and version tracking
    └── ide-integration.json    # IDE-specific settings
```

**File Structure Details:**

- **Command Files**: 5-10KB each, contain command metadata and routing logic
- **Cache Directory**: ~50MB full Spec-Kit content (downloaded on first use)
- **Scripts**: Cross-platform download and update utilities
- **Config**: Version tracking, cache policies, IDE integration settings

---

## 3. Multi-IDE Support

### Universal Command Interface

Both Claude Code and Cursor will use identical command syntax:

```
/constitution  # Define project principles
/specify       # Create specifications
/plan          # Technical planning
/tasks         # Task breakdown
/implement     # Execute implementation
```

### Claude Code Integration

**Implementation Method**: Native `.claude/commands/` directory

```
.claude/
└── commands/
    └── SpecKit/              # Spec-Kit command namespace
        ├── constitution.md
        ├── specify.md
        ├── plan.md
        ├── tasks.md
        └── implement.md
```

**Command Routing**: Each command references `.spec-kit/cache/` for full content

**Activation**: Commands automatically available in Claude Code command palette

### Cursor Integration

**Implementation Method**: Symlink to shared `.spec-kit/commands/` directory

```
.cursor/
└── commands/
    └── SpecKit/              # Symlink to .spec-kit/commands/
```

**Configuration**: `.cursor/spec-kit-integration.json` defines command availability

**Activation**: Commands appear in Cursor command palette with `Ctrl+K` prefix

### Unified Command Behavior

Both IDEs execute identical logic:

1. **Command Invocation**: User triggers `/constitution`, `/specify`, etc.
2. **Cache Check**: Command verifies `.spec-kit/cache/` exists
3. **Download Logic**: If cache missing, prompts to run download script
4. **Content Loading**: Loads full specification from cache
5. **Execution**: Processes command with full Spec-Kit methodology

**Cross-IDE Consistency Guaranteed**: Same commands, same behavior, same results across both IDEs.

## 4. Relationship with Other Workflows

### Spec-Kit as Independent Workflow

**Spec-Kit operates as its own standalone workflow methodology** while remaining accessible to all agent teams and compatible with existing workflows.

### Core Principle: Workflow Independence with Team Flexibility

**Key Concept**: Spec-Kit is a methodology (like BMAD), not a replacement for agent teams. Any agent can use Spec-Kit commands when appropriate.

### Three Distinct Workflow Options

**Option 1: Pure Spec-Kit Workflow**
- **When**: Formal specification-driven development required
- **Commands**: `/constitution` → `/specify` → `/plan` → `/tasks` → `/implement`
- **Agents**: Any custom agents (spec-analyst, spec-architect, backend-developer, etc.)
- **Output**: Formal specifications, comprehensive documentation, detailed task plans

**Option 2: Pure BMAD Workflow**
- **When**: Agile planning and execution preferred
- **Commands**: `/analyst` → `/pm` → `/architect` → `/dev` → `/qa`
- **Agents**: BMAD strategic agents
- **Output**: User stories, sprint plans, iterative deliverables

**Option 3: Custom Agent Workflow (No Framework)**
- **When**: Direct development without formal methodology
- **Commands**: Direct agent delegation (project-manager, backend-developer, etc.)
- **Agents**: Any custom agents as needed
- **Output**: Code, features, implementations

### Workflow Combination Scenarios

**Spec-Kit Can Work With Any Agent Team:**

**Scenario A: Spec-Kit + Custom Agents**
- Use Spec-Kit commands (`/constitution`, `/specify`, `/plan`)
- Execute with custom agents (spec-analyst, spec-architect, backend-developer)
- Benefits: Formal specifications + specialized agent expertise

**Scenario B: Spec-Kit + BMAD Agents (Cross-Review)**
- BMAD agents complete sprint documentation
- Use Spec-Kit `/specify` to review completeness
- Identify gaps and recommend additional documentation
- **Status**: Optional future enhancement (not currently planned)

**Scenario C: BMAD + Spec-Kit Commands**
- BMAD workflow for agile execution
- Specific components require formal specifications
- Use Spec-Kit `/specify` for formal documentation of critical modules
- Continue BMAD workflow for implementation

**Scenario D: Hybrid Formal/Agile Project**
- **Phase 1**: Spec-Kit for architecture and compliance design
- **Phase 2**: BMAD for iterative implementation sprints
- **Requirement**: Explicit phase transition with complete handoff

### Key Distinction: Methodology vs Team

**Spec-Kit** = Methodology (formal specification approach)
**BMAD** = Methodology (agile planning approach)
**Custom Agents** = Implementation team (backend, frontend, QA, etc.)

**Any agent can use Spec-Kit commands** when formal specifications are needed for their work.

**Any agent can use BMAD commands** when agile planning is needed for their work.

**Agents are not locked to methodologies**—they're tools available for any workflow.

### No Direct Integration Required

**Spec-Kit and BMAD remain independent methodologies:**
- Choose methodology based on project needs
- Agents execute within chosen methodology
- No forced integration or complexity
- Clear separation prevents hybrid confusion

## Appendix D: Workflow Flexibility Examples

### Example 1: Pure Spec-Kit with Custom Agents
```
Project: Healthcare compliance system
Requirement: HIPAA compliance, formal documentation

Workflow:
1. /constitution → spec-analyst defines compliance principles
2. /specify → spec-analyst creates detailed requirements
3. /plan → spec-architect designs secure architecture
4. /tasks → spec-planner breaks into implementation tasks
5. /implement → backend-developer, security-specialist build system

Result: Fully documented, compliant system with audit trail
```

### Example 2: Pure BMAD with Strategic Agents
```
Project: Internal analytics dashboard
Requirement: Rapid MVP, iterative improvement

Workflow:
1. /analyst → Market research on dashboard features
2. /pm → Define product requirements
3. /architect → Technical design decisions
4. /dev → Sprint-based implementation
5. /qa → Quality validation per sprint

Result: Working MVP in 2 weeks, iterative enhancements
```

### Example 3: Mixed Workflow - Spec-Kit Commands with BMAD Agents
```
Project: Customer portal with critical payment module
Requirement: Agile development but payment needs formal specs

Workflow:
1. /analyst → Overall product research (BMAD)
2. /pm → General requirements (BMAD)
3. /specify → Formal payment module specification (Spec-Kit)
4. spec-architect → Detailed payment security design (Custom)
5. /dev → Agile implementation of non-critical features (BMAD)
6. backend-developer → Payment module implementation (Custom)

Result: Formal payment documentation + agile feature delivery
```

### Example 4: Direct Custom Agent Work
```
Project: Bug fix in authentication system
Requirement: Quick resolution, well-understood issue

Workflow:
1. security-specialist → Identify vulnerability
2. backend-developer → Implement fix
3. spec-tester → Validate fix
4. quality-assurance-specialist → Approve deployment

Result: Fast, focused fix without methodology overhead
```

### Example 5: Hybrid Phase Approach
```
Project: Enterprise CRM system
Requirement: Complex, long-term, regulatory requirements

Phase 1 (Month 1-2): Spec-Kit for Architecture
- /constitution → Define enterprise principles
- /specify → Complete system specifications
- /plan → Comprehensive architecture design

Phase 2 (Month 3-8): BMAD for Implementation
- /pm → Sprint planning per module
- /dev → Iterative development
- /qa → Sprint validation

Phase 3 (Month 9+): Custom Agents for Maintenance
- Direct agent work for enhancements
- Quick fixes without framework overhead

Result: Solid foundation + agile delivery + efficient maintenance
```
