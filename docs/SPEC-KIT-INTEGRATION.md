# Spec-Kit Integration Plan

## Executive Summary

GitHub's Spec-Kit should be integrated as a **standalone tool** with minimal coupling to preserve your workspace's efficiency while gaining spec-driven benefits.

## Integration Approach: Minimal Standalone + Command Bridge

### Option 1: RECOMMENDED - Lightweight Command Integration

**Implementation:**
1. Install Spec-Kit as external tool via `uvx`
2. Create single Claude command for spec-driven projects
3. Use for greenfield projects requiring formal specifications
4. Keep existing workflows unchanged

**Advantages:**
- Zero overhead on existing projects
- No protocol conflicts
- Clean separation of concerns
- Can be removed without impact

**Code Required:** ~50 lines (one command file)

### Option 2: NOT RECOMMENDED - Global Workflow Integration

**Why Not:**
- Would require rewriting all 5 Laws to incorporate spec phases
- Conflicts with your surgical precision approach (Law #4)
- Adds mandatory specification overhead to all tasks
- Your current SDD/TDD protocol already covers specification needs

## Implementation Plan (Option 1)

### Step 1: Install Spec-Kit Tool
```bash
# One-time installation
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify check
```

### Step 2: Create Claude Command
Create `.claude/commands/spec-driven.md`:

```markdown
---
title: Spec-Driven Project
command: spec-driven
description: Initialize a new spec-driven development project using GitHub Spec-Kit
---

# Spec-Driven Project Command

Use this command to create new projects that require formal specification-driven development.

## Usage

```
/spec-driven <project-name>
```

## What It Does

1. Creates new project directory under `projects/`
2. Initializes Spec-Kit structure
3. Sets up specification workflow commands
4. Maintains compatibility with workspace protocols

## When to Use

- Greenfield projects requiring formal specs
- Client projects needing detailed documentation
- Experimental features with multiple implementation paths

## Implementation

\`\`\`bash
#!/bin/bash
PROJECT_NAME="$1"
PROJECT_PATH="projects/$PROJECT_NAME"

# Create project with Spec-Kit
uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init "$PROJECT_PATH" --ai claude

# Add workspace integration
cat >> "$PROJECT_PATH/CLAUDE.md" << 'EOF'

## Workspace Integration

This project uses Spec-Kit for specification-driven development while following workspace protocols:

- **Law #1**: Stop when uncertain about specifications
- **Law #2**: Specification phases are part of protocol adherence
- **Law #3**: Use appropriate agents for spec review
- **Law #4**: Keep specifications minimal and focused
- **Law #5**: Report specification progress to client

### Workflow

1. `/constitution` - Define project principles
2. `/specify` - Create functional specifications
3. `/plan` - Technical implementation plan
4. `/tasks` - Break down into micro-tasks
5. `/implement` - Execute with workspace agents

EOF

echo "Spec-driven project initialized at $PROJECT_PATH"
\`\`\`
```

### Step 3: Usage Pattern

**For Spec-Required Projects:**
```bash
/spec-driven my-new-app
cd projects/my-new-app
# Use Spec-Kit commands for specification
/constitution Create principles...
/specify Build an app that...
/plan Use React with...
# Then use workspace agents for implementation
/tasks
/implement
```

**For Regular Projects:**
Continue using existing `node scripts/new-project.js` workflow - no changes needed.

## Why This Approach?

1. **Surgical Precision (Law #4)**: Only 50 lines of integration code
2. **No Protocol Conflicts**: Spec-Kit operates independently
3. **Optional Usage**: Only for projects needing formal specs
4. **Easy Removal**: Delete one command file to remove
5. **Best of Both**: Spec-Kit's methodology + your agent orchestration

## What NOT to Do

❌ Don't modify existing protocols to accommodate Spec-Kit
❌ Don't make specifications mandatory for all projects
❌ Don't integrate Spec-Kit scripts into workspace automation
❌ Don't replace TodoWrite with Spec-Kit task management

## Maintenance

- Spec-Kit updates handled via `uvx` (no local code)
- Command file is self-contained
- No dependencies on workspace infrastructure

## Decision

Proceed with Option 1 - treats Spec-Kit as an optional tool for specific use cases while maintaining your optimized workspace integrity.
