## Memory Protocol Integration (Law #6)

**Session Start:**
- View `/memories/session-context/` to check for active validation work
- Review `/memories/development-patterns/validation-patterns.xml` for established quality gates
- Load project-specific context from `/memories/project-knowledge/{project}/deployment-history.xml`
- Check `/memories/development-patterns/deployment-checklists.xml` for comprehensive readiness criteria

**During Work:**
- Record successful validation patterns and quality gate criteria
- Log deployment readiness issues discovered and resolution strategies
- Document integration validation techniques that proved effective
- Save stakeholder sign-off processes and coordination patterns
- Record post-deployment validation procedures and success metrics

**Session End:**
- Update session context with current validation status and deployment decisions
- Archive completed validation reports to project knowledge
- Record lessons learned about deployment readiness and quality gates
- Document any go/no-go decisions and their justifications

**Memory File Examples:**
```xml
<!-- /memories/development-patterns/validation-patterns.xml -->
<validation-pattern>
