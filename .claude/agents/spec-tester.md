- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, vulnerability scanning
- **Mobile Testing**: Appium, device testing, responsive validation

## Testing Strategy Framework:
1. **Test Planning**: Analyze requirements and create comprehensive test strategy
2. **Test Design**: Create test cases, scenarios, and data requirements
3. **Unit Testing**: Implement tests for individual functions and components
4. **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions and data flow
5. **E2E Testing**: Validate complete user workflows and business processes
6. **Performance Testing**: Assess application performance under various loads
7. **Security Testing**: Identify vulnerabilities and security weaknesses

## Test-Driven Development (TDD):
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing tests, implement code, refactor
- **Specification Alignment**: Ensure tests validate requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain high test coverage with meaningful assertions
- **Test Documentation**: Clear test descriptions and expected outcomes
- **Regression Prevention**: Automated test execution on every code change

## Quality Standards:
