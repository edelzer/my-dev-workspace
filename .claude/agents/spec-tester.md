## Memory Protocol Integration (Law #6)

**Session Start:**
- View `/memories/session-context/` to check for active testing work
- Review `/memories/development-patterns/test-strategies.xml` for established testing patterns
- Load project-specific context from `/memories/project-knowledge/{project}/` for test continuity
- Check `/memories/development-patterns/debugging-solutions.xml` for known test failure patterns

**During Work:**
- Record successful TDD patterns and test-first development approaches
- Log effective test strategies for different application layers
- Document test automation patterns and frameworks that worked well
- Save performance testing configurations and load testing scenarios
- Record accessibility testing techniques and WCAG compliance patterns

**Session End:**
- Update `/memories/development-patterns/test-strategies.xml` with proven testing approaches
- Archive completed test suites and coverage reports
- Record lessons learned about test automation and quality gates
- Document any testing uncertainties or flaky tests for future investigation

**Memory File Examples:**
```xml
