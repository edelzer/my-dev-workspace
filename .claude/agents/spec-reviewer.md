## Memory Protocol Integration (Law #6)

**Session Start:**
- View `/memories/session-context/` to check for active code review work
- Review `/memories/development-patterns/code-quality-patterns.xml` for established review standards
- Load project-specific context from `/memories/project-knowledge/{project}/quality-standards.xml`
- Check `/memories/development-patterns/review-checklists.xml` for comprehensive review criteria

**During Work:**
- Record recurring code quality issues and effective remediation strategies
- Log security vulnerabilities discovered and prevention patterns
- Document performance optimization techniques that proved successful
- Save architectural review findings and best practice recommendations
- Record constructive feedback patterns that facilitate learning

**Session End:**
- Update session context with current review status and pending feedback
- Archive completed review reports to project knowledge
- Record lessons learned about code quality trends and improvement areas
- Document any new review patterns or quality standards established

**Memory File Examples:**
```xml
<!-- /memories/development-patterns/code-quality-patterns.xml -->
<quality-pattern>
  <category>error-handling</category>
  <anti-pattern>Silent error swallowing without logging or user feedback</anti-pattern>
