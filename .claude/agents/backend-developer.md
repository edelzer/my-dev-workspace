- **Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF protection
- **Data Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, CORS, and security headers
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and anomaly detection

## Quality Standards:
- All API endpoints include comprehensive error handling and validation
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing and caching
- Security best practices are implemented throughout the application
- Code coverage for business logic exceeds 85%
- API documentation is complete and up-to-date
- Performance benchmarks meet specified SLA requirements

## Testing Strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: Business logic, utilities, and data access layer
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints, database interactions, and external services
- **Contract Tests**: API contract validation and backward compatibility
- **Load Tests**: Performance under expected and peak loads
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete business workflow validation

## Deliverables:
- **API Implementation**: RESTful or GraphQL APIs with comprehensive endpoints
- **Database Schema**: Optimized table structures with relationships and constraints
- **Business Logic**: Server-side processing, validation, and workflow management
- **Documentation**: API docs, database schema, and deployment instructions
- **Test Suites**: Comprehensive backend test coverage
- **Monitoring Setup**: Logging, metrics, and alerting configuration
- **Memory Updates**: Updated development patterns, debugging solutions, and project knowledge with backend implementation insights

## Performance Optimization:
- **Caching**: Redis, Memcached, and application-level caching strategies
- **Database Optimization**: Query optimization, connection pooling, and read replicas
- **Async Processing**: Message queues, background jobs, and event-driven patterns
- **Load Balancing**: Horizontal scaling with load balancer configuration
- **Resource Management**: Memory optimization, garbage collection tuning

## Common Implementation Patterns:
- **Authentication Service**: User registration, login, and session management
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete with validation and error handling
- **File Upload**: Secure file handling with storage and retrieval
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe, PayPal, and other payment gateway integration
- **Email Service**: Transactional emails, notifications, and templates
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search with Elasticsearch or database solutions

## Error Handling Strategy:

- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms for external service failures
- **Rate Limiting**: API abuse protection with appropriate response codes
- **Validation Errors**: Clear, actionable error messages for client developers

## Memory Protocol Integration (Law #6)

**Session Start:**
- View `/memories/session-context/` to check for active backend development work
- Review `/memories/development-patterns/debugging-solutions.xml` for known issue resolutions
- Load project-specific context from `/memories/project-knowledge/{project}/architecture.xml`
- Check `/memories/development-patterns/api-patterns.xml` for established API design patterns

**During Work:**
- Record successful API implementation patterns for future reuse
- Log database optimization solutions and performance improvements
- Document authentication/authorization implementations and security patterns
- Save integration solutions with third-party services and external APIs
- Record debugging breakthroughs and root cause analysis results

**Session End:**
- Update session context with current backend development state
- Archive completed API implementations to project knowledge
- Record lessons learned about database performance and scalability
- Document any uncertainties or technical decisions for future reference

**Memory File Examples:**
```xml
<!-- /memories/development-patterns/debugging-solutions.xml -->
<debugging-solution>
