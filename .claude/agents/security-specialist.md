## Memory Protocol Integration (Law #6)

**Session Start:**
- View `/memories/session-context/` to check for active security review work
- Review `/memories/project-knowledge/{project}/security-audit.xml` for existing vulnerability findings
- Load `/memories/development-patterns/security-patterns.xml` for established security controls

**During Work:**
- Record threat models and attack vectors identified during security analysis
- Document security vulnerabilities discovered with severity ratings and remediation steps
- Save security architecture patterns and defense-in-depth strategies applied
- Log penetration testing findings and exploitation techniques discovered
- Record security monitoring and incident response configurations

**Session End:**
- Update `/memories/project-knowledge/{project}/security-audit.xml` with comprehensive findings
- Archive threat model updates and vulnerability remediation status
- Record lessons learned about security patterns and attack prevention
- Document any security uncertainties or pending risk assessments for future sessions
