### Requirements Audit Mode (Req-ing Ball Methodology):
**Purpose**: Comprehensive requirements traceability and compliance validation using systematic three-tier methodology for project-agnostic auditing.

**Project-Agnostic File Discovery**:
- **Primary Documentation**: `[PROJECT_ROOT]/project-documentation/product-requirements.md`, `[PROJECT_ROOT]/project-documentation/architecture-output.md`
- **Feature Specifications**: `[PROJECT_ROOT]/project-documentation/design-documentation/features/`, `[PROJECT_ROOT]/docs/requirements/`, `[PROJECT_ROOT]/docs/specifications/`
- **User Journey Maps**: `[PROJECT_ROOT]/project-documentation/design-documentation/user-journey-overview.md`
- **Search Patterns**: `**/requirements*.md`, `**/specs/*.md`, `**/.claude/docs/**/*.md`, `**/acceptance-criteria*.md`

**Three-Tier Validation Framework**:

**Tier 1: Requirements Traceability**
1. **Requirements Discovery**: Systematically locate and catalog all project requirements across documentation
2. **Implementation Mapping**: Trace each requirement to corresponding implementation components
3. **Coverage Analysis**: Identify gaps between specified requirements and actual implementation
4. **Bidirectional Validation**: Verify implementation components map back to documented requirements
5. **Requirements Classification**: Categorize functional, non-functional, security, and performance requirements

**Tier 2: Implementation Quality Assessment**
1. **Behavior Validation**: Verify implemented behavior matches requirement specifications exactly
2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Validate performance requirements against actual implementation metrics
3. **Error Handling Compliance**: Ensure error scenarios specified in requirements are properly handled
4. **Data Flow Verification**: Confirm data handling matches requirements specifications
5. **Integration Point Validation**: Verify external system integrations meet specified requirements

**Tier 3: User Journey Validation**
1. **End-to-End Workflow Verification**: Validate complete user journeys against acceptance criteria
2. **Acceptance Criteria Compliance**: Systematically verify each acceptance criterion is met
3. **User Experience Alignment**: Ensure implementation delivers specified user experience outcomes
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Validate handling of edge cases and alternative flows specified in requirements
5. **Cross-Functional Requirement Validation**: Verify requirements spanning multiple system components

**Compliance Scoring Framework**:
- **Overall Compliance Percentage**: Weighted average across all three tiers
- **Tier-Specific Scores**: Individual percentage for Requirements (40%), Implementation (35%), User Journey (25%)
- **Critical Gap Count**: Number of high-priority requirements not met
- **Risk Assessment**: High/Medium/Low risk classification based on gap analysis
- **Compliance Trend**: Improvement/degradation compared to previous audits

**Gap Analysis Dashboard**:
- **Critical Misses**: Requirements specified but not implemented or incorrectly implemented
- **Partial Implementations**: Requirements partially met with specific gaps identified
- **Executed to Spec**: Requirements fully implemented according to specifications
- **Above & Beyond**: Implementation exceeds specified requirements with added value
- **Architecture Compliance**: Alignment with specified architecture patterns and constraints
- **Non-Functional Gaps**: Performance, security, scalability requirement compliance

**Audit Commands and Processes**:
1. **Discovery Phase**: `req-audit discover` - Locate and catalog all requirements documentation
2. **Mapping Phase**: `req-audit map` - Create traceability matrix between requirements and implementation
3. **Validation Phase**: `req-audit validate` - Execute three-tier validation methodology
4. **Scoring Phase**: `req-audit score` - Generate compliance scores and risk assessment
5. **Reporting Phase**: `req-audit report` - Create structured audit report with gap analysis

**Integration with Existing Modes**:
- **Code Review Integration**: Requirements audit findings inform code review priorities and focus areas
