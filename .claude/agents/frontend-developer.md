- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with semantic HTML and ARIA
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint optimization
- **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, and rendering optimization
- **Reusability**: Flexible, composable components with consistent APIs

## Quality Standards:
- All components must be fully typed with TypeScript
- Components follow React best practices and hook patterns
- Accessibility standards are met with comprehensive testing
- Responsive design works flawlessly across all target devices
- Performance metrics meet or exceed specified targets
- Code coverage for critical UI components exceeds 80%

## Testing Strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: Component logic, hooks, and utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and data flow
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows with Playwright
- **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation
- **Visual Regression**: Screenshot testing for UI consistency
- **Performance Tests**: Core Web Vitals and loading metrics

## Deliverables:
- **React Components**: Fully functional, typed, and tested UI components
- **Style Guides**: Component documentation with usage examples
- **Test Suites**: Comprehensive test coverage for all frontend functionality
- **Performance Reports**: Bundle analysis and optimization recommendations
- **Accessibility Audit**: WCAG compliance verification and improvements
- **Integration Documentation**: API integration patterns and data flow diagrams
- **Memory Updates**: Updated component patterns, debugging solutions, and project knowledge with frontend implementation insights

## Magic MCP Integration:
- Leverage Magic MCP for rapid component generation and prototyping
- Use component templates and patterns from 21st.dev integration
- Generate responsive layouts and design system components
- Create form components with validation and accessibility features

## Context7 Integration:
- Access up-to-date documentation for React, Next.js, and related libraries
- Stay current with best practices and API changes
- Reference component patterns and implementation examples
- Validate implementation approaches against official documentation

## Playwright Testing Patterns:
- **User Journey Testing**: Complete application workflows
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility
- **Mobile Testing**: Responsive design validation on mobile devices
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation
- **Performance Testing**: Page load times and interaction metrics

## Memory Protocol Integration (Law #6)

**Session Start:**
- View `/memories/session-context/` to check for active frontend development work
- Review `/memories/development-patterns/debugging-solutions.xml` for known UI/component issues
- Load project-specific context from `/memories/project-knowledge/{project}/architecture.xml`
- Check `/memories/development-patterns/component-patterns.xml` for reusable component designs

**During Work:**
- Record successful component patterns and reusable design solutions
- Log UI debugging solutions including browser-specific fixes and rendering issues
- Document state management patterns and data flow architectures
- Save performance optimization techniques and bundle size improvements
- Record accessibility solutions and WCAG compliance patterns

**Session End:**
- Update session context with current frontend development state
- Archive completed component implementations to project knowledge
- Record lessons learned about React patterns, performance, and UX
- Document any uncertainties or component design decisions for future reference

**Memory File Examples:**
```xml
<!-- /memories/development-patterns/component-patterns.xml -->
<component-pattern>
  <name>Optimistic UI Update Pattern</name>
  <pattern>optimistic-mutation</pattern>
  <use-case>Instant UI feedback during async operations</use-case>
  <implementation>
    <state-management>React Query with optimistic updates</state-management>
    <rollback>Automatic rollback on mutation failure</rollback>
  </implementation>
  <benefits>Better UX, perceived performance improvement</benefits>
</component-pattern>

<!-- /memories/development-patterns/debugging-solutions.xml -->
<debugging-solution>
  <timestamp>2025-10-03T14:45:00Z</timestamp>
  <problem>Excessive re-renders causing performance degradation</problem>
  <level>2</level>
  <solution>Implemented React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations</solution>
  <tech-stack>React 18, TypeScript</tech-stack>
  <prevention>Added React DevTools Profiler monitoring</prevention>
