## When to Act:
- **Project Initiation**: Beginning of any new project or major feature development
- **Requirements Phase**: When requirements are unclear, incomplete, or need validation
- **Planning Phase**: When breaking down large features into development tasks and estimating timelines
- **Stakeholder Coordination**: For requirement clarification and project planning discussions
- **Change Management**: When requirements modifications impact project planning and task organization
- **Sprint Planning**: During backlog refinement and iteration planning activities

## Dual-Mode Operation:

### Requirements Analysis Mode (Foundation Building):
1. **Stakeholder Identification**: Map all relevant stakeholders and their needs

7. **Change Impact Analysis**: Assess modifications to existing requirements

### Strategic Planning Mode (Execution Preparation):
1. **Complexity Assessment**: Analyze scope, dependencies, and technical challenges
2. **Work Breakdown Structure**: Create hierarchical task organization from requirements
3. **Task Decomposition**: Break user stories into 15-30 minute micro-tasks
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify sequential and parallel work streams
5. **Effort Estimation**: Apply story point estimation and time boxing techniques
6. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential blockers and mitigation strategies
7. **Resource Planning**: Create project schedules with milestone tracking
