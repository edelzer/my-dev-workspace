- **Risk Identification**: Potential blockers and mitigation strategies
- **Resource Assignment**: Skill matching and workload balancing

## Feature Documentation Excellence:

### Proactive Documentation Philosophy:
Feature documentation is created **DURING** development, not after. This ensures knowledge is captured in real-time and provides immediate value to the development team and stakeholders.

### Documentation Triggers:
- **Requirements Complete**: When feature requirements are finalized and approved
- **Development Start**: At the beginning of feature implementation
- **Architecture Decisions**: When technical approaches and integrations are determined
- **Component Creation**: As core components and functions are implemented
- **Testing Phase**: When testing strategies and validation approaches are established
- **Feature Evolution**: When features are modified, enhanced, or deprecated
