# BMAD Deployment & Monitoring Workflow

## Overview
This workflow orchestrates deployment and monitoring using BMAD agents with custom validation agents for reliable, monitored production deployments.

## Deployment Team Architecture

### BMAD Deployment Support
- **`/bmad-orchestrator`** - Master orchestration for deployment coordination
- **`/architect`** - Infrastructure validation and deployment architecture
- **`/qa`** - Final deployment validation and smoke testing

### Custom Deployment Agents
- **`spec-validator`** - Pre-deployment validation and go/no-go decisions
- **`security-specialist`** - Security validation and compliance checking
- **`spec-reviewer`** - Post-deployment validation and monitoring setup

## Deployment Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation
**Lead Agent**: `spec-validator`
**Supporting**: `security-specialist`, `/architect`

#### Pre-Deployment Checklist
```
1. spec-validator - System Readiness Assessment

   - Vulnerability scan results reviewed
   - Compliance requirements verified
   - Access control validation

3. /architect - Infrastructure Readiness
   - Deployment environment validated
   - Resource allocation confirmed
   - Monitoring systems operational
   - Backup procedures verified
```

#### Go/No-Go Decision Matrix
- **Code Quality**: ✅ All quality gates passed
- **Security**: ✅ No critical vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: ✅ Benchmarks met
- **Infrastructure**: ✅ Environment ready

- **Team Readiness**: ✅ Support team available

### Phase 2: Deployment Execution
**Lead Agent**: `/bmad-orchestrator`
**Supporting**: `spec-validator`, `/architect`

#### Deployment Sequence
```
1. /bmad-orchestrator - Deployment Coordination
   *workflow deployment
   - Coordinate deployment sequence
   - Monitor deployment progress
   - Manage team communication
   - Handle deployment issues

2. Automated Deployment Pipeline
   - Code deployment to staging
   - Automated smoke tests
   - Database migrations
   - Configuration updates
   - Production deployment

3. Real-time Monitoring Activation
   - Application performance monitoring
   - Error tracking and alerting
   - Security monitoring
   - User experience tracking
```

#### Deployment Validation Points
- **Staging Deployment**: Validate in staging environment
- **Smoke Tests**: Critical functionality validation
- **Performance Check**: Response time and throughput validation
- **Security Check**: Runtime security validation
- **User Acceptance**: Final business validation

### Phase 3: Post-Deployment Monitoring
**Lead Agent**: `spec-reviewer`
**Supporting**: `security-specialist`, `/qa`

#### Monitoring Implementation
```
1. spec-reviewer - Monitoring Setup
   - Performance monitoring configuration
   - Error tracking and alerting
   - User experience monitoring
   - System health dashboards

2. security-specialist - Security Monitoring
   - Intrusion detection system
   - Vulnerability monitoring
   - Compliance monitoring
   - Incident response procedures

3. /qa - Ongoing Validation
   - Continuous user acceptance testing
   - Business metric monitoring
   - Feature usage analytics
   - Customer feedback tracking
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Blue Environment**: Current production system
- **Green Environment**: New deployment for validation
- **Switchover**: Traffic routing from blue to green after validation
- **Rollback**: Quick switchback to blue if issues detected

### Canary Deployment
- **Phased Rollout**: Gradual traffic routing to new version
- **Risk Mitigation**: Limited user exposure to potential issues
- **Validation**: Real user validation before full deployment
- **Scaling**: Gradual increase in traffic allocation

### Rolling Deployment
- **Instance Replacement**: Sequential server updates
- **Zero Downtime**: Continuous service availability
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic distribution during updates
- **Health Checks**: Continuous service validation

## Monitoring & Alerting Framework

### Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- **Response Times**: API and page load performance
- **Throughput**: Request volume and processing capacity
- **Error Rates**: Application and system error tracking
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and storage utilization

### Business Metrics Monitoring
- **User Engagement**: Feature usage and user behavior
- **Conversion Metrics**: Business goal achievement
- **Customer Satisfaction**: User experience indicators
- **Revenue Impact**: Business value measurement

### Security Monitoring
- **Intrusion Detection**: Unauthorized access attempts
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Ongoing security assessment
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Regulatory requirement adherence
- **Incident Response**: Security event handling

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **System Health**: Server and service availability
- **Network Performance**: Connectivity and bandwidth
- **Database Performance**: Query performance and capacity
- **Third-party Services**: External dependency monitoring

## Incident Response Workflow

### Alert Escalation
```
Level 1: Automated Resolution
├── Self-healing systems
├── Automatic scaling
└── Configuration rollback

Level 2: Development Team
├── On-call developer notification
├── Initial problem assessment
└── Quick fix implementation

Level 3: Cross-functional Team
├── /bmad-orchestrator coordination
├── Multi-team incident response
└── Comprehensive problem resolution

Level 4: Executive Escalation
├── Business impact assessment
├── Customer communication
└── Post-incident review
```

### Rollback Procedures
- **Automated Rollback**: Triggered by critical alerts
- **Manual Rollback**: Team-initiated emergency response
- **Database Rollback**: Data consistency maintenance
- **Communication**: Stakeholder notification procedures

## Continuous Improvement Process

### Post-Deployment Review
- **Performance Analysis**: Deployment success metrics
- **Issue Resolution**: Problem identification and solutions
- **Process Improvement**: Workflow optimization opportunities
- **Team Learning**: Knowledge sharing and documentation

### Metrics-Driven Optimization
- **Deployment Frequency**: Release velocity tracking
- **Lead Time**: Feature development to production time
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: Incident resolution speed
- **Change Failure Rate**: Deployment success percentage
