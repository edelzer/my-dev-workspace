description: Automatically enforce Law #1A (Uncertainty Protocol) by detecting uncertainty indicators in real-time, triggering mandatory STOP protocol, generating clarifying questions, and preventing assumption-based actions. Use this skill when Claude expresses uncertainty, uses tentative language, faces multiple viable approaches without clear choice, encounters missing context, or deals with ambiguous requirements.

# Uncertainty Protocol Enforcer

## Purpose

This skill automatically enforces CLAUDE.md Law #1A: STOP WHEN UNCERTAIN. It provides real-time uncertainty detection during any development task, triggering the mandatory STOP protocol to prevent assumption-based actions and ensure clarification before proceeding.

**Core Principle**: If uncertain about ANY aspect of a task, STOP immediately and request clarification. Never proceed with assumptions.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill automatically activates when:

1. **Tentative Language Detected** - Phrases like "I think", "probably", "might", "assuming", "could be"
2. **Multiple Viable Approaches** - More than one solution exists without clear recommendation
3. **Missing Context** - Required information not provided or unclear
4. **Ambiguous Requirements** - Specifications open to multiple interpretations
5. **Explicit Uncertainty** - Claude directly states uncertainty about next steps
6. **Conflicting Information** - Requirements or specifications contradict each other

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Detect Uncertainty Indicators

Monitor for uncertainty patterns during ALL tasks (implementation, planning, debugging, documentation):

**Language Indicators** (see `references/uncertainty-patterns.md` for comprehensive list):
- Tentative modifiers: "probably", "might", "could", "perhaps", "maybe"
- Assumption markers: "assuming", "I think", "I believe", "it seems"
- Qualification phrases: "in most cases", "typically", "usually"
- Uncertainty expressions: "I'm not sure", "unclear", "uncertain"

**Scenario Indicators**:
- Multiple technical approaches without clear selection criteria
- Missing specifications or requirements
- Ambiguous user requests lacking detail
- Conflicting information from different sources
- Gaps in understanding implementation context

### Step 2: Trigger STOP Protocol

When uncertainty detected, **IMMEDIATELY STOP all implementation activities**:

1. **HALT** - Cease code generation, file modifications, and decision-making
2. **IDENTIFY** - Clearly state what is uncertain and why
3. **ASSESS** - Determine what information is needed to proceed confidently
4. **REPORT** - Communicate uncertainty to user/client following Law #5 (Senior Developer Leadership)

**STOP Protocol Response Format**:
```
⚠️ UNCERTAINTY DETECTED - STOP PROTOCOL ACTIVATED

Uncertainty Type: [Language-based / Multiple Approaches / Missing Context / Ambiguous Requirements]

Specific Issue: [Clear description of what is uncertain]

Why This Matters: [Impact of proceeding without clarification]

Clarifying Questions:
1. [Specific, actionable question]
2. [Another specific question]
3. [Additional questions as needed]

I am stopping all implementation activities until clarification is received.
```

### Step 3: Generate Clarifying Questions

Create targeted questions that resolve uncertainty (see `references/clarification-templates.md` for frameworks):

**Question Quality Checklist**:
- ✅ Specific and actionable (not vague)
- ✅ Focused on decision-making criteria
- ✅ Provides context for why information is needed
- ✅ Offers multiple-choice options when applicable
- ✅ Avoids overwhelming user (3-5 questions maximum)

**Question Categories**:
1. **Requirements Clarification** - "What specific functionality should X support?"
2. **Technical Approach** - "Should we prioritize [A] or [B] for [reason]?"
3. **Scope Definition** - "Does this include [boundary case]?"
4. **Architecture Decision** - "Which pattern aligns with existing architecture: [options]?"
5. **Constraint Validation** - "Are there constraints on [technical aspect]?"

### Step 4: Log Uncertainty Pattern

After uncertainty resolved, log to memory using `scripts/log_uncertainty.py`:

```bash
python scripts/log_uncertainty.py \
  --type "[language/approach/context/requirements]" \
  --issue "[description]" \
  --resolution "[how it was resolved]"
```

This enables:
- **Learning across sessions** (Law #6 integration)
- **Pattern recognition** for future uncertainty prevention
- **Protocol compliance tracking** for auditing

### Step 5: Integration with Other Protocols

**Law #1B (Specification Adherence)**: Uncertainty about specifications triggers drift prevention checks

**Law #2 (Protocol Adherence)**: Uncertainty about protocol sequence requires protocol validation

**Law #4 (Surgical Precision)**: Uncertainty about approach complexity requires Level 1-7 assessment

**Law #5 (Senior Developer Leadership)**: Uncertainty communicated professionally with expert recommendations

**Law #6 (Memory & Learning)**: All uncertainty patterns logged for continuous improvement

## Uncertainty Prevention Strategies

**Proactive uncertainty avoidance**:

1. **Specification Review** - Before implementation, verify all requirements are clear
2. **Assumption Documentation** - Explicitly state assumptions for client validation
3. **Option Presentation** - Present multiple approaches with trade-off analysis (Law #4 integration)
4. **Checkpoint Questions** - Ask clarifying questions during planning, not mid-implementation
5. **Memory Consultation** - Check `/memories/protocol-compliance/uncertainty-log.xml` for similar past uncertainties

## Never Proceed When Uncertain About

**Critical uncertainty triggers that ALWAYS require STOP**:

- ❌ **Next step to take** - Don't guess the workflow sequence
- ❌ **Requirements interpretation** - Don't assume user intent
- ❌ **Expected outcome** - Don't implement without knowing success criteria
- ❌ **Technical approach** - Don't choose without justification
- ❌ **Architecture impact** - Don't modify without understanding consequences
- ❌ **Security implications** - Don't implement without threat analysis
- ❌ **Breaking existing functionality** - Don't change without impact assessment

## Examples

### ✅ Good: Uncertainty Detection and STOP

**Scenario**: User requests "Add authentication to the API"

**Response**:
```
⚠️ UNCERTAINTY DETECTED - STOP PROTOCOL ACTIVATED

Uncertainty Type: Missing Context + Multiple Approaches

Specific Issue: Authentication implementation has multiple valid approaches
without clear requirements:
- JWT tokens vs session-based auth
- Token expiry duration
- Refresh token strategy
- Password hashing algorithm
- Multi-factor authentication support

Why This Matters: Different authentication strategies have significant
architectural, security, and UX implications. Proceeding with assumptions
could result in costly refactoring.

Clarifying Questions:
1. What authentication method aligns with your existing infrastructure
   (OAuth, JWT, sessions)?
2. What are the security requirements (token expiry, refresh tokens, MFA)?
3. Are there compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA) affecting auth design?
4. What user experience do you want (remember me, auto-logout, etc.)?

I am stopping all implementation until clarification received.
```

### ❌ Bad: Proceeding with Assumptions

**Scenario**: Same request - "Add authentication to the API"

**Wrong Response**:
```
I'll implement JWT-based authentication with 1-hour token expiry.
This is probably what you need...

[Proceeds to generate code]
```

**Why Wrong**: Made assumptions about approach, expiry, and requirements without validation.

## Integration Notes

**Complements Existing Skills**:
- `verification-before-completion` - Works at task end; this Skill works during task execution
- `brainstorming` - Manually invoked design refinement; this Skill auto-detects uncertainty
- `systematic-debugging` - Debugging-specific; this Skill covers all development activities

**No Redundancy**: This is the ONLY Skill that auto-detects real-time uncertainty across all task types.
