# Checkpoint and Recovery Systems

## Overview
This system provides comprehensive checkpoint creation and recovery mechanisms for BMAD workflows, ensuring robust fault tolerance, disaster recovery, and seamless workflow resumption capabilities.

## Checkpoint System Architecture

### 1. Checkpoint Types and Triggers
```
Automatic Checkpoints:
├── Phase Transition Checkpoints (before/after phase changes)
├── Quality Gate Checkpoints (before/after major validations)
├── Critical Decision Checkpoints (architecture, technology choices)
├── Team Handoff Checkpoints (cross-functional transitions)
├── Time-Based Checkpoints (every 4 hours of active work)
└── Risk Event Checkpoints (when significant risks materialize)

Manual Checkpoints:
├── User-Requested Checkpoints (explicit save points)
├── Experiment Checkpoints (before trying new approaches)
├── Milestone Checkpoints (major deliverable completions)
└── Emergency Checkpoints (before high-risk operations)

Intelligent Checkpoints:
├── Complexity-Based (when workflow complexity increases)
├── Progress-Based (at significant progress milestones)
├── Resource-Based (when team composition changes)
└── Context-Based (when business context significantly changes)
```

### 2. Checkpoint Creation Process
**Trigger Detection → State Capture → Validation → Storage → Metadata → Notification**

```bash
create_checkpoint() {
    local checkpoint_type=$1
    local trigger_reason=$2
    local priority=$3
    
    # Generate unique checkpoint ID
    local checkpoint_id=$(generate_checkpoint_id "$checkpoint_type" "$trigger_reason")
    
    # Capture complete workflow state
    capture_workflow_state "$checkpoint_id"
    capture_agent_states "$checkpoint_id" 
    capture_context_states "$checkpoint_id"
    capture_progress_states "$checkpoint_id"
    capture_resource_states "$checkpoint_id"
    
    # Validate checkpoint integrity
    validate_checkpoint_integrity "$checkpoint_id"
    
    # Store checkpoint with metadata
    store_checkpoint "$checkpoint_id" "$checkpoint_type" "$trigger_reason" "$priority"
    
    # Update checkpoint registry
    update_checkpoint_registry "$checkpoint_id"
    
    # Notify relevant stakeholders if high priority
    if [[ "$priority" == "high" ]]; then
        notify_stakeholders_checkpoint_created "$checkpoint_id" "$trigger_reason"
    fi
}
```

## Recovery System Architecture

### 1. Recovery Scenarios and Strategies
```
Recovery Scenarios:
├── Agent Failure Recovery (single agent restart/replacement)
├── Partial System Recovery (subset of agents/services affected)
├── Complete System Recovery (full system restart)
├── Data Corruption Recovery (state file corruption)
├── Network Partition Recovery (communication breakdown)
└── Human Error Recovery (incorrect actions/decisions)

## Recovery Procedures

### 1. Automated Recovery Procedures
**Failure Detection → Assessment → Strategy Selection → Execution → Validation**

```bash
initiate_recovery() {
    local failure_type=$1
    local affected_components=$2
    local recovery_priority=$3
    
    # Assess failure impact
    failure_impact=$(assess_failure_impact "$failure_type" "$affected_components")
    
    # Select optimal recovery strategy
    recovery_strategy=$(select_recovery_strategy "$failure_impact" "$recovery_priority")
    
    # Find best checkpoint for recovery
    target_checkpoint=$(find_optimal_checkpoint "$failure_type" "$affected_components")
    
    # Execute recovery process
    case $recovery_strategy in
        "hot_recovery")
            execute_hot_recovery "$target_checkpoint"
            ;;
        "warm_recovery") 
            execute_warm_recovery "$target_checkpoint"
            ;;
        "cold_recovery")
            execute_cold_recovery "$target_checkpoint"
            ;;
    esac
    
    # Validate recovery success
    validate_recovery_success "$target_checkpoint"
    
    # Resume workflow from recovered state
    resume_workflow_from_checkpoint "$target_checkpoint"
}
```

### 2. Manual Recovery Procedures
**Interactive Recovery**: Guided recovery process with human oversight

```
Manual Recovery Steps:
1. Failure Analysis
   ├── Identify root cause of failure
   ├── Assess data integrity and corruption scope
   ├── Evaluate impact on project timeline and deliverables
   └── Document failure details for post-mortem analysis

2. Recovery Planning
   ├── Review available checkpoints and their suitability
   ├── Assess recovery time requirements vs. business needs
   ├── Plan communication to stakeholders and team members
   └── Prepare rollback plan in case recovery fails

3. Checkpoint Selection
   ├── Evaluate checkpoint integrity and completeness
   ├── Assess work loss implications (time since checkpoint)
   ├── Consider business continuity requirements
   └── Validate checkpoint compatibility with current environment

4. Recovery Execution
   ├── Create pre-recovery backup of current state (if possible)
   ├── Execute state restoration from selected checkpoint
   ├── Validate all system components and agent states
   └── Test critical workflow functionality

5. Workflow Resumption
   ├── Re-establish agent communication channels
   ├── Validate context and progress consistency
   ├── Resume workflow from appropriate step
   └── Monitor for recovery-related issues
```

## Recovery Testing and Validation

### 1. Recovery Testing Framework
**Purpose**: Validate recovery procedures work reliably under various failure scenarios

```
Recovery Test Scenarios:
├── Single Agent Failure (individual agent crash/corruption)
├── Multiple Agent Failure (coordinated agent failures)
├── Communication Breakdown (network partition scenarios)
├── State Corruption (partial/complete state file corruption)
├── Storage Failure (checkpoint storage unavailability)
├── Cascade Failures (failure triggering additional failures)
└── Human Error Simulation (accidental data deletion/modification)
```

### 2. Recovery Validation Procedures
```bash
validate_recovery_success() {
    local checkpoint_id=$1
    local validation_results=""
    
    # Validate workflow state consistency
    validate_workflow_state_integrity
    validation_results+="workflow_state:$? "
    
    # Validate agent state restoration
    validate_all_agent_states
    validation_results+="agent_states:$? "
    
    # Validate context consistency
    validate_context_consistency  
    validation_results+="context_consistency:$? "
    
    # Validate inter-agent communication
    test_agent_communication_channels
    validation_results+="communication:$? "
    
    # Validate workflow functionality
    test_workflow_basic_functionality
    validation_results+="functionality:$? "
    
    # Generate validation report
    generate_recovery_validation_report "$checkpoint_id" "$validation_results"
}
```
