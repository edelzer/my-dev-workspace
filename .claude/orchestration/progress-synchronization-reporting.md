# Progress Synchronization and Reporting

## Overview
This system provides real-time progress synchronization across all BMAD agents and custom development agents with comprehensive reporting and visibility into project status, team performance, and milestone achievement.

## Progress Tracking Architecture

### 1. Multi-Level Progress Hierarchy
```
Project Level Progress
├── Phase Progress (Planning/Development/QA/Deployment)
├── Epic Progress (Major features and capabilities)
├── Story Progress (User stories and requirements)
├── Task Progress (Individual work items)
└── Micro-Task Progress (15-30 minute work units)
```

### 2. Progress Data Structure
**Location**: `docs/progress/` directory structure
```

```

## Real-Time Progress Synchronization

### 1. Progress Update Protocol
**Trigger**: Any significant agent action or task completion
**Process**:
```
Agent Action Completion
    ↓
Progress Impact Assessment
    ↓
Update Relevant Progress Files
    ↓
Calculate Cascade Impact (Task → Story → Epic → Phase → Project)
    ↓
Synchronize Cross-Team Dependencies
    ↓
Update Progress Dashboard
    ↓
Trigger Automated Reports (if thresholds met)
    ↓
Notify Stakeholders (if required)
```

### 2. Progress Data Format
**Standard Progress Record**:
```json
{
  "item_id": "unique-identifier",
  "item_type": "project|phase|epic|story|task|micro-task",
  "title": "Human-readable title",
  "status": "not_started|in_progress|blocked|completed|cancelled",
  "progress_percentage": 0-100,
  "assigned_agent": "agent-identifier",
  "start_date": "ISO-8601-timestamp",
  "due_date": "ISO-8601-timestamp",

### 3. Progress Visualization Tools
**Implementation**: Automated generation of visual progress indicators

#### Progress Dashboard Components
```
Visual Elements:
├── Project Timeline with Milestone Markers
├── Team Velocity Charts (Historical and Trending)
├── Quality Metrics Gauges (Coverage, Defect Rates)
├── Resource Utilization Heatmaps
├── Risk and Issue Severity Indicators
└── Stakeholder Communication Status
```

## Synchronization Mechanisms

### 1. Real-Time Progress Updates
**Integration Points**: All agent actions that affect progress

```bash
# Hook integration for automatic progress updates
# (integrates with Rule2Hook system)

update_progress() {
    agent_name=$1
    action_type=$2
    affected_items=$3
    
    # Update individual item progress
    update_item_progress "$affected_items"
    
    # Calculate cascade effects
    update_dependent_items "$affected_items"
    
    # Refresh aggregated metrics
    recalculate_project_metrics
    
    # Trigger reports if thresholds met
    check_reporting_triggers
    
    # Notify stakeholders if required
    check_notification_triggers
}
```

### 2. Cross-Team Progress Coordination
**Process**: Ensure progress updates consider cross-team dependencies

```
Dependency Impact Analysis:
├── Identify all dependent tasks/stories/epics
├── Calculate impact on dependent timelines
├── Update resource allocation projections
├── Adjust milestone predictions
└── Communicate changes to affected agents
```

### 3. Progress Validation and Consistency
**Quality Assurance**: Ensure progress reporting accuracy

```
Progress Validation Rules:
├── Task completion requires evidence (code, documentation, tests)
├── Story completion requires all acceptance criteria met
├── Epic completion requires all stories completed
├── Phase completion requires all quality gates passed
└── Project completion requires all deliverables validated
```

## Integration with Agent Workflows

├── TodoWrite status updates automatically sync to progress system
├── Micro-task completion feeds into larger work item progress
└── Cross-agent task dependencies tracked and reported

Progress Reporting Commands:
├── Each custom agent reports progress in standardized format
├── Progress updates include effort estimation accuracy
├── Quality metrics integrated into progress reporting
└── Blocker identification and escalation automated
```

## Stakeholder Communication

### 1. Automated Stakeholder Updates
**Triggers**: Significant milestone achievement, critical issues, schedule changes

```
Stakeholder Notification Rules:
├── Milestone Achievement: Automatic notification with progress summary
├── Critical Issues: Immediate notification with impact assessment  
├── Schedule Changes: 24-hour advance notification with alternatives
├── Quality Gate Failures: Same-day notification with recovery plan
└── Resource Issues: 48-hour advance notification with resolution timeline
```

### 2. Executive Dashboard Access
**Real-Time Visibility**: Stakeholders can access current project status anytime

```
Executive Dashboard Features:
├── High-level project health indicators
├── Milestone progress and predictions
├── Budget and resource utilization
├── Key risk and issue summary
├── Team performance metrics
└── Stakeholder action items
```

This progress synchronization and reporting system ensures complete visibility into project status while enabling proactive management of issues, risks, and stakeholder expectations.
