**Procedure**:
```
1. Initialize Test Project
   /analyst
   *create-project-brief

**Procedure**:
```
1. Initiate Context Change
   /pm
   *update-requirements "Add mobile-responsive design requirement"
   
2. Monitor Context Propagation
   Check immediately after PM update:
   - docs/context/business-context.md reflects change
   - Technical context updated with mobile implications
   - Development task priorities adjusted
   
3. Agent Response Validation
   /architect (5 minutes after update)
   "Review updated requirements for mobile responsiveness"
   
   frontend-developer (10 minutes after update)
   "Adjust UI components for mobile responsiveness"
   
   Validation Points:
   - All agents reference updated requirements
   - Technical implications properly addressed
   - Task priorities reflect new requirements
   - No conflicting interpretations
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Context updates propagate within 2 minutes
- [ ] All agents receive and acknowledge updates
- [ ] No inconsistent interpretations across agents
- [ ] Task priorities automatically adjusted

#### Test 2.2: Context Conflict Detection and Resolution
**Purpose**: Test conflict identification and resolution communication
**Procedure**:
```
1. Create Intentional Context Conflict
   /pm (Agent A)
   "Set authentication deadline to March 15"
   
   /architect (Agent B, simultaneously)  
   "Technical analysis shows authentication needs 4 weeks (April 1)"
   
2. Monitor Conflict Detection
   Check: Automated conflict detection triggers
   Check: Conflict documented in resolution system
   Check: Affected agents notified
   
3. Validation Resolution Communication
   spec-developer (conflict mediator)
   "Facilitate resolution of authentication timeline conflict"
   
   Validation Points:
   - All stakeholders included in resolution discussion
   - Options clearly communicated and evaluated
   - Decision rationale documented and shared
   - Resolution updates all affected contexts
```

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Conflict detected within 5 minutes
- [ ] All affected agents notified automatically  
- [ ] Resolution process initiated promptly
- [ ] Final decision communicated to all stakeholders

### 3. High-Volume Communication Tests

#### Test 3.1: Parallel Agent Communication
**Purpose**: Test communication reliability under concurrent agent activity
**Procedure**:
```
1. Simultaneous Multi-Agent Activity
   # Start all agents simultaneously
   Terminal 1: /sm - Create 5 development stories
   Terminal 2: frontend-developer - Implement 3 UI components
   Terminal 3: backend-developer - Create 4 API endpoints  
   Terminal 4: spec-tester - Write tests for 6 features
   Terminal 5: /qa - Review 3 completed stories
   
2. Monitor Communication Performance
   Track:
   - Message delivery times between agents
   - Context update propagation speed
   - Progress synchronization accuracy

   # During active multi-agent workflow
   Simulate: Network interruption between agents
   Simulate: Agent process restart during handoff
   Simulate: Context file lock conflicts
   
2. Monitor Recovery Mechanisms
   Check:
   - Automatic retry mechanisms activate
   - Context synchronization recovery
   - Lost message detection and redelivery
   - State consistency restoration
   
3. Validate Complete Recovery
   Verify after recovery:
