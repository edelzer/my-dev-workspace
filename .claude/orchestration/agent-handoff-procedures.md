# Agent Handoff Procedures

## Overview
This document defines standardized handoff procedures between BMAD agents and custom development agents to ensure seamless workflow transitions with complete context preservation.

## Core Handoff Principles

### 1. Context Completeness
- **Full Information Transfer**: All relevant context, decisions, and deliverables
- **Decision Rationale**: Why specific choices were made
- **Constraint Documentation**: Technical and business limitations identified
- **Success Criteria**: Clear definition of completion requirements

### 2. Validation Gates
- **Deliverable Completeness**: All required outputs generated and validated
- **Quality Standards**: Minimum quality thresholds met
- **Dependency Resolution**: All prerequisites satisfied for next phase
- **Stakeholder Approval**: Required approvals obtained before handoff

### 3. Communication Protocol
- **Structured Handoff**: Standardized information format
- **Acknowledgment Process**: Receiving agent confirms understanding
- **Clarification Loop**: Mechanism for resolving gaps or questions
- **Documentation Trail**: Permanent record of handoff decisions
