    <issue>JWT token expiry time not specified in requirements</issue>
    <context>Implementing authentication middleware for user management API. Security requirements specify JWT authentication but do not define token expiry duration. Industry standards vary from 5 minutes to 24 hours depending on use case.</context>
    <clarification-requested>What is the required JWT token expiry time for this application? Should we implement refresh tokens for longer session persistence?</clarification-requested>
    <options-presented>
      <option id="A">5 minutes (high security, frequent refreshes required)</option>
      <option id="B">15 minutes (balanced security and UX, industry standard for sensitive applications)</option>
      <option id="C">1 hour (better UX, lower security for sensitive operations)</option>
      <option id="D">24 hours (maximum convenience, requires additional security measures)</option>
    </options-presented>
    <resolution>Client approved Option B: 15 minutes (900 seconds) with refresh token mechanism for session extension</resolution>

    <issue>Password strength requirements undefined</issue>
    <context>Implementing user registration endpoint. Security requirements mention "strong passwords" but do not specify minimum length, character requirements, or complexity rules.</context>
    <clarification-requested>What are the specific password strength requirements? Should we follow NIST guidelines, OWASP recommendations, or custom requirements?</clarification-requested>
    <options-presented>
      <option id="A">NIST 800-63B: Minimum 8 characters, no complexity requirements (focus on length and breach checking)</option>
      <option id="B">OWASP: Minimum 10 characters, at least 3 of 4 character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special)</option>
      <option id="C">Enterprise: Minimum 12 characters with complexity requirements and password history</option>
    </options-presented>
    <resolution>Client approved Option A: NIST 800-63B guidelines - minimum 8 characters, no mandatory complexity, implement breach detection via HaveIBeenPwned API</resolution>
