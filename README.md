/dev *implement-story              # Sequential task execution
/qa *review-story                  # Quality assurance review

# Document management
/po *shard-documents               # Break large docs into focused files
/po *validate-story                # Story validation against artifacts
```

```bash
# Existing project enhancement
/architect *document-project        # Document current system state
/pm *create-brownfield-prd         # Enhancement requirements
/architect *create-brownfield-architecture  # Integration-focused design
/pm *create-brownfield-epic        # Quick epic for focused changes
/pm *create-brownfield-story       # Single story for small changes
```

### 🔧 **BMAD Configuration**

The BMAD system is configured via `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Project structure configuration
prd:
  prdFile: docs/prd.md              # Product Requirements Document
  prdShardedLocation: docs/prd      # Broken down requirements
architecture:
  architectureFile: docs/architecture.md  # System architecture
  architectureShardedLocation: docs/architecture  # Detailed design docs

# Developer context (always loaded for dev agent)
devLoadAlwaysFiles:
  - docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
  - docs/architecture/tech-stack.md
  - docs/architecture/source-tree.md
```

### 🌟 **Using BMAD in This Workspace**

#### **Integrated Mode** (Recommended)
BMAD agents work alongside your custom development agents:

```bash
# Strategic planning with BMAD
/analyst → /pm → /architect

# Implementation with custom agents  
spec-developer → frontend-developer → backend-developer

# Quality assurance hybrid
/qa → spec-reviewer → security-specialist
```

#### **Standalone Mode**
Use BMAD as a complete development methodology:

```bash
# Full BMAD workflow
/analyst → /pm → /architect → /po → /sm → /dev → /qa

# BMAD-only development cycle
/bmad-master *help    # Get started with BMAD methodology
```

### 🎯 **When to Use BMAD vs Custom Agents**

#### **Use BMAD For:**
- **Large, complex projects** requiring systematic planning
- **Enterprise development** with formal requirements
- **Brownfield enhancements** to existing systems
- **Multi-sprint projects** with changing requirements
- **Team coordination** across multiple developers

#### **Use Custom Agents For:**
- **Quick prototypes** and experimental features
- **Code-level tasks** like debugging and optimization
- **Security analysis** and vulnerability assessment
- **Performance optimization** and monitoring
- **Specific technical implementations**

### 🔄 **Hybrid Workflow Example**

A typical project might use both systems:

```bash
# 1. Strategic Planning (BMAD)
/analyst → /pm → /architect → /po

# 2. Technical Foundation (Custom Agents)
spec-architect → security-specialist → spec-planner

# 3. Implementation (Hybrid)
/dev + frontend-developer + backend-developer

# 4. Quality Assurance (Hybrid)  
/qa → spec-reviewer → spec-validator

# 5. Deployment (Custom Agents)
security-specialist → spec-validator
```

This gives you the **strategic depth of BMAD** combined with the **technical precision of custom agents** - the best of both worlds for professional development.
