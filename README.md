## Quick Start

1. **Create a new project**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/new-project.js my-app web
   ```

2. **Navigate to your project**:
   ```bash
   cd projects/my-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and start development**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Templates

All templates now use centralized configuration management for consistency and maintainability:

- **API**: Node.js + TypeScript + Express (optimized configs)
- **Mobile**: React Native (consistent base configs)
- **Desktop**: Electron (standardized configuration)

### Template Features

│   ├── eslint.base.js         # Common ESLint rules
│   ├── typescript.base.json   # Common TypeScript settings
│   ├── prettier.base.js       # Standardized formatting
│   ├── jest.base.js          # Common testing configuration
│   └── vitest.base.js        # Common Vitest configuration
├── templates/          # Template-specific overrides
│   ├── web.eslint.js         # Web-specific overrides

│   ├── mobile.eslint.js      # Mobile-specific overrides
│   └── desktop.eslint.js     # Desktop-specific overrides
└── validation/         # Configuration validation tools
    ├── config-validator.js   # Consistency checker
    └── sync-validator.js     # Synchronization validator
```
