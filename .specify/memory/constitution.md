================================================
Version Change: [TEMPLATE] → 1.0.0 (initial ratification)
Ratification Date: 2025-10-18

Principles Defined:
  1. Code Quality - Comprehensive quality standards and review requirements
  2. Security First - Security-by-design approach with proactive threat modeling
  3. User Experience - User-centric design with accessibility and performance focus

Sections Added:
  - Core Principles (3 principles)
  - Quality Standards (quality gates and code review)
  - Development Workflow (TDD, security integration, performance monitoring)
  - Governance (amendment procedures and compliance)

Templates Status:
  ✅ plan-template.md - Constitution Check section compatible
  ✅ spec-template.md - User scenarios align with UX principle
  ✅ tasks-template.md - Task organization supports quality and testing principles
  ⚠️ Commands/*.md - No updates needed (test constitution only)
  ⚠️ README.md - No updates needed (test constitution only)

Follow-up TODOs: None (this is a Session 3 integration test)

NOTE: This is a TEST CONSTITUTION for Session 3 integration testing.
      It should be reverted or replaced with a real constitution before production use.

# Test Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality

All code MUST meet the following quality standards before merging:
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (minimum 80% for new code)
- Integration tests for all public APIs and user-facing features
- Static analysis passing with zero critical or high-severity issues
- Code review approval from at least one other developer
- Documentation for all public interfaces and complex logic

**Rationale**: High code quality reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and accelerates
long-term development velocity by preventing technical debt accumulation.

### II. Security First

Security is a foundational design principle, not an afterthought:
- All features MUST undergo threat modeling during design phase
- Input validation and sanitization required for all external data
- Authentication and authorization enforced at every system boundary
- Secrets management via secure vaults, never hardcoded or committed
- Security scanning integrated into CI/CD pipeline with blocking failures
- Regular dependency audits and timely updates for vulnerabilities

**Rationale**: Security breaches damage user trust, create legal liability, and require
expensive remediation. Security-by-design is more effective and less costly than
retrofitting security later.

### III. User Experience

User-centric design drives all product decisions:
- Features MUST solve real user problems with measurable value
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum) for all interfaces
- Performance budgets enforced: page load <2s, interaction response <100ms
- User testing and feedback incorporated before major releases
- Error messages MUST be clear, actionable, and user-friendly
- Design consistency maintained across all product surfaces

**Rationale**: Products succeed by delivering exceptional user experiences. Poor UX leads
to user abandonment, negative reviews, and product failure regardless of technical
excellence.

## Quality Standards

**Code Review Requirements**:
- All changes reviewed by at least one other team member
- Automated tests MUST pass before review
- Security implications explicitly addressed in review
- Performance impact assessed for user-facing changes

**Testing Gates**:
- Unit tests for all business logic and utilities
- Integration tests for API contracts and data flows
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance regression testing for key metrics

## Development Workflow

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
- Write failing tests before implementing features
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly followed for new functionality
- Test coverage monitored and maintained above quality thresholds

**Security Integration**:
- Threat models created during design phase
- Security review required for authentication, authorization, and data handling changes
- Automated security scanning in pre-commit and CI/CD pipelines

**Performance Monitoring**:
- Performance budgets defined and enforced
- Metrics collected for load times, response times, resource usage
- Performance regressions trigger investigation and resolution

## Governance

**Amendment Procedure**:
- Constitution amendments require documentation of rationale and impact
- Team consensus or stakeholder approval required for MAJOR version changes
- Version bumps follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- All amendments documented in Sync Impact Report

**Compliance Review**:
- All pull requests MUST verify compliance with constitution principles
- Non-compliance identified in code review MUST be resolved before merge
- Exceptions require explicit justification and approval from tech lead

**Versioning Policy**:
- MAJOR: Backward-incompatible governance or principle changes
- MINOR: New principles added or existing principles materially expanded
- PATCH: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-18 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-18
