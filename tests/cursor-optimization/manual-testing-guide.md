## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step manual testing procedures to validate the Cursor optimization system in a real Cursor IDE environment.

## Prerequisites

- Cursor IDE installed and running
- Workspace opened: `my-dev-workspace`
- All 15 agents available in `.cursor/agents/`
- `.cursorrules` file active

## Test Categories

### 1. Agent Invocation Testing

#### Test 1.1: Chat @mention Pattern

**Objective:** Verify agents can be invoked via Chat with @mentions

**Steps:**

1. Open Cursor Chat panel (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+`)
2. Type `@` and start typing `.cursor/agents/foundation/spec-analyst`
3. Verify autocomplete shows the agent file
4. Select the agent and add request: "analyze requirements for user login feature"
5. Send the message

**Expected Results:**

- Agent file appears in autocomplete
- Agent responds with requirements analysis
- Response follows spec-analyst persona and expertise
- Response includes handoff suggestions to next agent

**Pass Criteria:** ✅ Agent responds appropriately with structured analysis

#### Test 1.2: Composer Multi-Agent Workflow

**Objective:** Verify complex multi-agent workflows in Composer

**Steps:**

1. Open Composer (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Add context: `@.cursor/agents/foundation/spec-analyst.md`
3. Request: "Analyze requirements for e-commerce checkout flow"
4. Review response, then add: `@.cursor/agents/foundation/spec-architect.md`
5. Request: "Design system architecture based on the requirements analysis"
6. Continue with `@.cursor/agents/implementation/spec-developer.md`
7. Request: "Implement the checkout flow based on the architecture"

**Expected Results:**

- Each agent builds on previous agent's work
- Context is maintained across agent handoffs
- Agents reference previous analysis/design appropriately
- Implementation follows architectural decisions

**Pass Criteria:** ✅ Seamless multi-agent workflow with context preservation

#### Test 1.3: Sequential Agent Handoffs

**Objective:** Verify agents suggest appropriate next agents

**Steps:**

1. Use Chat with `@.cursor/agents/foundation/spec-analyst.md`
2. Request: "Analyze requirements for user authentication system"

3. Observe agent response

**Expected Results:**

- Agent identifies the ambiguity
- Agent stops and requests specific clarification
- Agent follows Law #1 uncertainty protocol
- Agent doesn't make assumptions

**Pass Criteria:** ✅ Agent properly handles uncertainty per Law #1

#### Test 3.2: Law #6 - Memory Integration

**Objective:** Verify agents integrate with memory system

**Steps:**

1. Use an agent for a specific task
2. Note any memory references in response
3. Check if agent suggests memory updates
4. Verify memory integration patterns

**Expected Results:**

- Agent references memory system when appropriate
- Agent suggests memory updates for significant decisions
- Agent follows Law #6 memory protocols
- Cross-session context preservation mentioned

**Pass Criteria:** ✅ Agent properly integrates memory system per Law #6

### 4. System Integration Testing

#### Test 4.1: Complete Feature Development Workflow

**Objective:** Test complete development workflow using agent system

**Steps:**

1. Start with requirements analysis using spec-analyst
2. Move to architecture design with spec-architect
3. Create task breakdown with spec-planner
4. Implement with spec-developer
5. Test with spec-tester
6. Review with spec-reviewer
7. Validate with spec-validator

**Expected Results:**

- Each phase builds on previous work
- Context is maintained throughout
- Quality gates are enforced
- Final output is production-ready

**Pass Criteria:** ✅ Complete workflow produces high-quality deliverable

#### Test 4.2: Cross-Category Agent Coordination

**Objective:** Verify agents from different categories work together

**Steps:**

1. Use foundation agent (planning)
2. Hand off to implementation agent (development)
3. Hand off to quality agent (testing/validation)
4. Verify coordination between categories

**Expected Results:**

- Smooth handoffs between categories
- Context preservation across categories
- Appropriate expertise application
- Quality standards maintained

**Pass Criteria:** ✅ Seamless cross-category coordination

### 5. Performance and Usability Testing

#### Test 5.1: Response Quality Assessment

**Objective:** Evaluate quality of agent responses

**Steps:**

1. Test each agent category with appropriate requests
2. Evaluate response quality, accuracy, and usefulness
3. Check for appropriate expertise demonstration
4. Verify professional communication standards

**Expected Results:**

- Responses demonstrate appropriate expertise
- Communication is professional and clear
- Recommendations are actionable
- Quality meets senior developer standards

**Pass Criteria:** ✅ All agents provide high-quality, expert responses

#### Test 5.2: System Efficiency Testing
